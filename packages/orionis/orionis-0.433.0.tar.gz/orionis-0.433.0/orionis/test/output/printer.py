        Display the result of a single unit test in a formatted manner using the Rich library.

        This method prints the outcome of an individual unit test to the console, showing a status icon
        (‚úÖ for passed, ‚ùå for failed) along with the test name. If the test failed, the first line of the
        error message is also displayed for quick reference. The output is styled for clarity and does not

        Parameters
        ----------
        test_result : Any
            An object representing the result of a unit test. It must have the following attributes:
                - status: An enum or object with a 'name' attribute indicating the test status (e.g., "PASSED", "FAILED").
                - name: The name of the test.
                - error_message: The error message string (present if the test failed).

        Notes

        - If the test passed, only the status and test name are displayed.
        - If the test failed, the status, test name, and the first line of the error message are shown.

        Determine if any test case in the provided flattened test suite contains active debugging or dumping calls.

        This method inspects the source code of each test case instance in the given list to check for the presence
        of specific debugging or dumping method calls (such as 'self.dd' or 'self.dump'). Only lines that are not
        commented out are considered. If any such call is found in the source code, the method immediately returns True,

        Parameters
        ----------

            A list of test case instances whose source code will be inspected for debugging or dumping calls.

        Returns
        -------

            (e.g., 'self.dd' or 'self.dump'). Returns False if no such calls are found or if an exception occurs
            during inspection.

        Notes
        -----
        - Lines that are commented out (i.e., start with '#') are ignored during inspection.

        Extract and return the most relevant portion of a traceback string that pertains to a specific test file.

        This method processes a full Python traceback and attempts to isolate the lines that are directly related
        to the provided test file. It does so by searching for the test file's name within the traceback and collecting
        all subsequent lines that are relevant, such as those containing 'File' or non-empty lines. If the test file's
        name cannot be determined or no relevant lines are found, the original traceback is returned. If the traceback
        is empty, a default message is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        test_path : str
            The file path of the test file whose related traceback lines should be extracted.
        traceback_test : str

        Returns
        -------

            Returns a string containing only the relevant traceback lines associated with the test file.
            If no relevant lines are found or the file name cannot be determined, the full traceback is returned.
