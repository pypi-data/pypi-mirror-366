    Interface for OrionisTestResult, a custom test result collector that extends
    unittest's TextTestResult to include rich execution metadata such as
    execution time, error tracebacks, and reflection-based information.

    Classes implementing this interface are responsible for capturing detailed
    information about each test case execution, including success, failure,
    error, and skip states.
