    Abstract interface for test kernel implementations.

    This contract defines the required methods that any test kernel implementation
    must provide for the Orionis testing framework. It ensures consistent behavior
    across different test kernel implementations.

    The test kernel is responsible for:
    - Managing application context for testing
    - Validating and handling test configuration
    - Orchestrating test discovery and execution
    - Providing a unified interface for test operations
