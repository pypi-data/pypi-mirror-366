class Singleton(type):
    """
    Thread-safe and async-safe singleton metaclass.

    Ensures that only one instance of a class exists, regardless of whether the code is running in a synchronous or asynchronous context. This metaclass provides both a synchronous (`__call__`) and asynchronous (`__acall__`) method for instance creation, using appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded or async environments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _instances : Dict[Type[T], T]
        Stores singleton instances for each class using this metaclass.
    _lock : threading.Lock
        Thread lock for synchronizing instance creation in synchronous contexts.
    _async_lock : asyncio.Lock
        Async lock for synchronizing instance creation in asynchronous contexts.

    Methods
    -------
    __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
        Synchronously creates or retrieves the singleton instance.
    __acall__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
        Asynchronously creates or retrieves the singleton instance.

    def __call__(cls: Type[T], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> T:
        """
        Synchronously creates or retrieves a singleton instance of the class.

        This method ensures that only one instance of the class is created, even in multi-threaded environments.
        If the instance does not exist, it acquires a thread lock to prevent race conditions, creates the instance,
        and stores it in the class-level `_instances` dictionary. If the instance already exists, it simply returns
        the existing instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : Any
            Positional arguments to pass to the class constructor.
        **kwargs : Any
            Keyword arguments to pass to the class constructor.

        Returns
        -------
        T
            The singleton instance of the class.
