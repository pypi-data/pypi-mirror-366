            This method does not return anything. It asserts the existence of required methods.

        Notes
        -----
        This test ensures that the AsyncTestCase class contains all necessary asynchronous lifecycle methods
        for proper setup and teardown in asynchronous test scenarios.

        -----
        This test verifies that the lifecycle methods are implemented as coroutine functions,
