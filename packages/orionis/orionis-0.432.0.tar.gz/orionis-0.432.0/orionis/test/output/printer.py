        ----------
        test_result : Any
            An object representing the result of a unit test. It must have the following attributes:
                - status: An enum or object with a 'name' attribute indicating the test status (e.g., "PASSED", "FAILED").
                - name: The name of the test.

        Determine if any test case in the provided flattened test suite contains active debugging or dumping calls.

        This method inspects the source code of each test case instance in the given list to check for the presence
        of specific debugging or dumping method calls (such as 'self.dd' or 'self.dump'). Only lines that are not

        Parameters
        ----------

        Returns
        -------

            during inspection.

        Notes
        -----
        - Lines that are commented out (i.e., start with '#') are ignored during inspection.

        Extract and return the most relevant portion of a traceback string that pertains to a specific test file.

        This method processes a full Python traceback and attempts to isolate the lines that are directly related
        to the provided test file. It does so by searching for the test file's name within the traceback and collecting
        all subsequent lines that are relevant, such as those containing 'File' or non-empty lines. If the test file's
        name cannot be determined or no relevant lines are found, the original traceback is returned. If the traceback
        is empty, a default message is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        test_path : str
            The file path of the test file whose related traceback lines should be extracted.
        traceback_test : str
            The complete traceback string to be sanitized.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            Returns a string containing only the relevant traceback lines associated with the test file.
            If no relevant lines are found or the file name cannot be determined, the full traceback is returned.
