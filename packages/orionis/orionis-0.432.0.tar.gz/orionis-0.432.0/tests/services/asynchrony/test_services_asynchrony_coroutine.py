        Tests coroutine execution without an active event loop.

        This method simulates the scenario where a coroutine is executed in a synchronous context,
        such as a standard Python script, where no event loop is running. It verifies that the
        Coroutine wrapper can correctly create and manage an event loop internally, execute the
        coroutine, and return the expected result.

        Tests execution of a non-coroutine object.

        raises an OrionisCoroutineException. It ensures that the Coroutine class enforces
        the requirement for coroutine objects and does not accept regular functions or other types.
