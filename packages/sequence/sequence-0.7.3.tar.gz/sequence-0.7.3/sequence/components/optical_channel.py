"""Models for simulation of optical fiber channels.

This module introduces the abstract OpticalChannel class for general optical fibers.
It also defines the QuantumChannel class for transmission of qubits/photons and the ClassicalChannel class for transmission of classical control messages.
OpticalChannels must be attached to nodes on both ends.
