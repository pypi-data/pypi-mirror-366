    """
    A "private" class with the responsibility to initialize and shutdown the .NET ScriptAdapter class.

    I considered making `ProjectStore` a context manager; however, the API then becomes somewhat unclear.

        - Does the constructor enter the context? Must a caller initialize the instance and then enter the
          context?
        - What results if a caller *does not* enter the context?
        - Enters the context twice?

    Because I was uncertain I created this private class to model the `ScriptAdapter` context. The property,
    `ProjectStore.native_project`, enters the context if it will actually read the project and exits the
    context when the read operation is finished.

    For information on Python context managers, see
    [the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#context-manager-types)
