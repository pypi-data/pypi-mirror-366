"""
Expose constants to the Orchid Python API.

The .NET stage QC "class" implementation depends upon a number of constants. This module exposes those constants to the
Orchid Python API.
"""

import uuid

class CorrectionStatus(enum.Enum):
    # TODO: Change to use .NET `Enum` member.
    # Python.NET always transforms .NET `Enum` members into Python `int` values. This transformation is a known issue
    # (https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet/issues/1220). The Python.NET team has corrected the issue but only for
    # Python.NET 3.x; it has no plans for a backport.
    #
    # Although I have successfully use the Python.NET transformation of .NET `Enum` members to `ints`; I have
    # encountered issues with its usage in .NET `Variant` types which is used for stage QC information.
    #
    # To simplify the "work-around" implemented in `native_stage_qc_adapter`, I use the hard-coded string value of
    # .NET `CorrectionStatus`.
    #
    # See also the Jupyter notebook, `features/notebooks/explore_stage_qc.py`, for attempts to use the .NET `Enum`.
