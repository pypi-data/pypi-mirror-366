    """
    Saves `project`, optionally to `maybe_to_pathname` is an optimized, but possibly "unsafe" manner.

    If `maybe_to_pathname` is supplied and is not `None`, it must be a string representing a valid pathname. If a file
    with that pathname already exists, it will be overwritten (unless it is the same path as `source_pathname`)

    This method is unsafe because it only writes some data from `project`; the remainder of the data is simply
    (bulk) copied from the `.ifrac` file, `source_pathname`.

    This method assumes that `project` was originally loaded from `project_pathname` and was then changed in
    such a way that the "bulk" data **was not** changed. If this assumption is not true, the project saved in
    `to_pathname` will **not** contain all the changes to `project`.

    Specifically, this method **does not** save changes to data like:

    - Trajectories
    - Treatment curves
    - Monitor curves

    We believe that this method will generally finish more quickly than `save_project`; however, we cannot
    guarantee this behavior. We encourage the developer calling this method to perform her own performance tests
    and to understand if his use case meets the assumptions made by this method.

    Args:
        project: The project to be saved.
        source_pathname: The pathname of the `.ifrac` file from which `project` was loaded.
        maybe_target_pathname: The optional pathname of the `.ifrac` file in which to store `project`.

    Examples:
        >>> # Test optimized but possibly unsafe save of project
        >>> load_path = orchid.training_data_path().joinpath('Project_frankNstein_Permian_UTM13_FEET.ifrac')
        >>> loaded_project = orchid.load_project(str(load_path))
        >>> save_path = load_path.with_name(f'salva intuta{load_path.suffix}')
        >>> orchid.optimized_but_possibly_unsafe_save(loaded_project, str(load_path), str(save_path))
        >>> save_path.exists()
        True
        >>> save_path.unlink()
        >>> # Test optimized but possibly unsafe save of project in loaded location
        >>> source_path = orchid.training_data_path().joinpath('Project_frankNstein_Permian_UTM13_FEET.ifrac')
