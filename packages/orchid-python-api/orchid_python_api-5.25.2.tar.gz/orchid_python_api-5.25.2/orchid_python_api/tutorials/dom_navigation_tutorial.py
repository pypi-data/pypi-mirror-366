    # 1.0 Load the .ifrac project

    # The following code simply captures the configured location of the Orchid training data. It is not
    # needed to use the Orchid Python API itself, but it is used in this example to load a well-known
    # `.ifrac` file.

    # Our project is now loaded in memory. An Orchid project has many collections of other items. For
    # example, a project has a collection of wells, and a well has a collection of stages.
    #
    # Each of these objects, for example, each well and each stage, is identified by a unique identifier (an
    # instance of `uuid.UUID`). However, these identifiers, in order to be unique, are **not** easily
    # remembered by people. Further, Orchid **does not** require that alternatives, like a well name or
    # display name, be unique. To allow for convenient searching, project objects like wells and stages are
    # kept in a `SearchableProjectObjects` collection. This class provides methods for searching for more
    # specific instances:
    #
    # - `find_by_object_id()` - Returns the matching object or `None` if no such object exists
    # - `find_by_name()` - Returns an **iterator** of matching objects (since more than one may match).
    # - `find_by_display_name()` - Returns an **iterator** of matching objects.
    #
    # It provides methods returning all valid values of these keys:
    #
    # - `all_object_ids()`
    # - `all_names()`
    # - `all_display_names()`
    #
    # Since `find_by_object_id()`, `find_by_name()` and `find_by_display_name()` do not exhaust the criteria
    # you might want to use to find objects of interest, we have included a more generic method, `find()`,
    # that takes a predicate (a callable) and returns an iterator over all objects for which the predicate
    # returns `True`.
    #
    # Finally, we provide the general ability to iterate over all project objects using two mechanisms. The
    # older mechanism is the `all_objects()` method that returns an iterator over all objects in the
    # collection.
    #
    # Beginning with version 2021.3.318 of the Orchid Python API, we have made `SearchableProjectObjects` an
    # iterator. This change allows one to use the very familiar Python idiom of:
    #
    # ```
    # for well in projects.wells():
    #     // processing
    #     for a single well
    # ```
    #
    # Additionally, one can use `SearchableProjectObjects` in list, dictionary and generator expressions. For
    # example, to create a dictionary of wells keyed by the well object ID (since ** only ** object ID is
    # guaranteed to be unique) one would write:
    #
    # ```
    # wells_by_id = {well.object_id: well for well in project.wells()}
    # ```
    #
    # Using `SearchableProjectObjects` as an iterator is very general, is easily understood, and is most
    # useful when exploring a project interactively at a REPL. However, we have seen that using this general
    # technique easily leads to duplicated code to search through the collection of project objects for the
    # specific object that you actually need for your application. Consequently, we encourage you to use the
    # query methods of `SearchableProjectObjects`, including the general `find(...)` methods, first. If those
    # do not meet your needs, please let us know by creating
    # [an issue](https://github.com/Reveal-Energy-Services/orchid-python-api/issues).

    # 2.0 Query well "keys"

    # Particularly during exploration of a project, you may not know the specific object in which you are
    # interested, but you know something about its name or its display name. The Orchid Python API provides
    # you with the `all_names()` and `all_display_names()` to iterate over those names.
