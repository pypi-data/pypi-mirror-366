    """
    Convert a `Measurement` instance to the same measurement in `target_unit`.

    The order of arguments allows easier conversion of a sequence of `Measurement` instances (with the same
    unit) to another unit. For example, if client code wished to convert a sequence of force measurements from
    US oilfield units to metric units (that is, pound-force to Newtons). Code to perform this conversion might
    be similar to the following:

    > make_metric_force = to_unit(units.Metric.FORCE)
    > metric_force_measurements = [make_metric_force(f) for f in us_oilfield_force_measurements]
    > # alternatively,
    > # metric_force_measurements = toolz.map(make_metric_force, us_oilfield_force_measurements)

    Args:
        source_measurement: The Measurement instance to convert.
        target_unit: The units to which I convert `source_measurement`.
    """
    return source_measurement.to(target_unit.value.unit)
