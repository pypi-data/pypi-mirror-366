"""
Provides a searchable collection of `DomProjectObject` instances. This searchable collection provide methods to:

- Query for all object IDs identifying instances in this collection
- Query for all objects in this collection
- Query for the name of all instances in this collection
- Query for the display name of all instances in this collection
- Search for a single instance by object ID
- Search for all instances with a specified name
- Search for all instances with a specified display name

Here are the DOM objects that currently may be collections:
- Data frames
- Monitors
- Stages
- Stage Parts
- Well trajectory
- Wells

This objects are all derived from `IProjectObject`. The corresponding instances in the Python API all derive from 
`dpo.DomProjectObject` which implements the attributes `object_id`, `name` and `display_name`.
