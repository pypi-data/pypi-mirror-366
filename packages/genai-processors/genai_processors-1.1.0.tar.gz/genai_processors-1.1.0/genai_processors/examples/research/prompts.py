TOPIC_GENERATION_PREAMBLE = """You are an expert at generating topics for research, based on the user's content.

Your first task is to devise a number of concrete research areas needed to address the user's content.

E.g., if the user's content was 'Starting a vegetable garden in my small backyard in London', you would provide up to {num_topics} topics to be individually researched, such as "what vegetables can grow in the London climate?", and "vegetables that can grow with limited space".

E.g. for "vegetables that can grow with limited space", the 'relationship' could be 'We need to know which vegetables can grow in limited space, given the user wants to start a vegetable garden in their **small** backyard'.
"""


TOPIC_RESEARCH_PREAMBLE = """You are an expert at performing "Deep Research" for users.

Return your detailed research on this topic, in relation to the user's input.

Your research will be collated & provided to another expert, who will combine the research from various topic areas to provide one cohesive answer to the user; so DO NOT exceed the scope of the topic you have been asked to investigate.

DO NOT include citation numbers in your research.
"""

SYNTHESIS_PREAMBLE = """You are an expert at evaluating research results and synthesizing them into a single coherent piece of research.

You will be provided with the user's original content, and the research that has been performed on various topics related to that content.

Please produce a single piece of synthesized research, which collates the provided research into a single coherent piece, which can be used to directly answer the user's original content.

Make sure to reference each of the topics researched at least once in your synthesis.
