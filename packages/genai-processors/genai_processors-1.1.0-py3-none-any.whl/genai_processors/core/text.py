class MatchProcessor(processor.Processor):
  r"""Processor finding text patterns and extracting them from the input stream.

  There are two modes controlled by the `remove_from_input_stream` parameter.

  1. [True] When the pattern is found, the matched text is removed from the
     input stream and returned as a single part with the substream name
     `substream_output` and the mimetype text/plain.
  2. [False] When the pattern is found, it is not removed from the input stream.
     It is still returned as a single part with the substream name
     `substream_output` and the mimetype text/plain.

  Example [mode 1]:
  ```python
    p = MatchProcessor(
          word_start='[',
          pattern=r'\[.*\]',
          substream_output='from_regex'
        )
    output = processor.apply_sync(p, ['a', 'b', 'c[d', 'e]f','g'])
    ```
    output will contain 6 parts:

    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('a', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('b', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('c', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('[de]',
         mimetype='text/plain',
         substream_name='from_regex',
       )
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('f', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('g', mimetype='text/plain')

    The text part of `output` will be `abcfg`.

  In [mode 2], the output will be:

    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('a', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('b', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('c[d', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('e]f', mimetype='text/plain')
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('[de]',
         mimetype='text/plain',
         substream_name='from_regex',
       )
    -  content_api.ProcessorPart('g', mimetype='text/plain')

  When using this processor in a real-time setting, it is recommended to set
  `remove_from_input_stream` to False. This will allow the processor to output
  the parts as soon as possible and not block the stream. If you still need
  to remove the matched text from the input stream, it is advised to define a
  short `word_start` and/or flush conditions (via `flush_fn`) that are met often
  to reset the buffer and to keep producing parts in the output stream.

    """Extracts text parts from the input stream that match the pattern.

    Only considers text parts from the input stream `substream_input`.

    See class docstring for more details.

    This processor buffers input parts until one of the following happens:

    1. the `pattern` is found, then it outputs all parts in the buffer up to the
      end of the match.
    2. when the `flush_fn` returns True, then it outputs all parts in the
      buffer.

    When `word_start` is set, the following happens:

    3. the word_start is found, then it outputs all the parts before the
      `word_start`.
    4. `word_start` is not found in buffer_text[-len(word_start):], where
       buffer_text is the concatenation of all the text parts in the buffer. All
       parts whose text is in buffer_text[-len(word_start):] are returned.

    While in the buffer, the parts are not output which means they can lead to
    delays in the output stream.

    To avoid such delays, set the `remove_from_input_stream` to False and/or
    define a `flush_fn` that returns True often to discard the parts in the
    buffer frequently.

    Args:
      pattern: pattern to match a text to extract into a part. When
        `remove_from_input_stream` is True, the matched text will be removed
        from the stream and will be replaced by a single extracted part. The
        parts before and after this match will be returned as is. Note that by
        default, re.DOTALL is used to match newlines. To override this behavior,
        pass a re.Pattern object instead.
      word_start: text to match the start of the text that needs to be captured.
        `word_start` is not a regular expression but a plain string that will be
        matched exactly. `word_start` should be a substring of the pattern and
        should indicate that the pattern is about to be matched. Whenever
        `word_start` is found, the parts after it will be buffered (not
        returned) until the pattern is found, the `flush_fn` returns True, or
        the input stream is exhausted. When set to None (default), this logic is
        not applied.
      substream_input: name of the substream to use for the input part.
      substream_output: name of the substream to use for the extracted part.
      flush_fn: function to check when to reset the buffer and yield all the
        parts in the buffer. The part where `flush_fn` returns True will be
        returned as is and will not be matched against the pattern.
      remove_from_input_stream: if True, the processor will remove the matched
        parts from the input stream. If False, the input stream will be
        preserved and the parts will be returned as is quickly. The processor
        will output into its `substream_output` substream once a match is found.
      transform: A transformation to be applied to the matched Parts.

  Also see core/web.py for the infrastructure to fetch the extracted URLs.
  Alternatively see core/github.py for a processor that provides a tailored

  In some scenarios it is useful to replace URLs mentioned in the prompt with
  the content they point to. In many cases it can be handled by tool calls, but
  if we want to avoid additional roundtrip or the underlying model does not
  support tools, hardwired logic might be preferrable.

  We recommend splitting detecting the URLs and fetching them into separate
  processors. The processor that does the fetching should act on Parts with a
  special MIME type to avoid fetching them unintentionally. And a separate
  processor should decide which URLs should be processed.

  Usage:
    In the basic case use UrlExtractor() without arguments and handle
    FetchRequest parts produced. Alternatively you can define separate
    dataclasses for specific URL prefixes:

      @dataclasses_json.dataclass_json
      @dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
      class YouTubeUrl:
        url: str

    And then tell UrlExtractor to extract them:

      UrlExtractor({
          'https://youtube.': YouTubeUrl,
          'https://github.com': GithubUrl
      })
