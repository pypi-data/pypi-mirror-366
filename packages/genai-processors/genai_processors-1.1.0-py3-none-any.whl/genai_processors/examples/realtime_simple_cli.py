r"""Command Line Interface to run a simple live audio agent.

This agent uses the Gemini API with live/conversation.py to use a turn-based
Gemini model to interact with the user in a real-time conversation similar to
a Live API setup. This is audio only.

## Setup

To install the dependencies for this script, run:

```
pip install --upgrade pyaudio genai-processors google-genai termcolor
```

Before running this script, ensure the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
environment variables are set to the api-key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

Important: **Use headphones**. This script uses the system default audio
input and output, which often won't include echo cancellation. So to prevent
the model from interrupting itself it is important to use headphones.

## Run

To run the script:

```shell
python3 ./realtime_simple_cli.py
```
