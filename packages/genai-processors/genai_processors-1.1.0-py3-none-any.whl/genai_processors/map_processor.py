r"""Chaining of a sequence of 1:many function across a stream concurrently.

To execute all functions concurrently we build up a tree of results.
Given:
- A content stream of c={c0, c1, .., cN}
- A sequence of functions f={f0, f1, .., fM}

We have the following tree with streaming content on the x-axis and functions
on the y-axis.

    -> Content Stream ->
     c0   c1  c2  .. cN

f0   o    o   p   ..
     |\   |   |
f1   p o  o   o
       |  |
f2     o  o
       |  |
..
       |  |
fM     r  r

   o = complete node (all children fetched)
   p = pending node (potentially more children)
   r = result node (has a result to be yielded)

For the tree above the following has happened:
- f0(c0) has yielded 2 children
- f1(f0(c0)[0]) is executing and hasn't yielded any children yet
- fM(... f0(c0)[1]) has executed all functions and has a result to be returned
- fM(... f0(c1)[0]) has executed all functions and has a result to be returned
- f0(c2) has yielded 1 child and is pending (may yield more children)
- f1(f0(c2)[0]) has finished and returned no children


Currently no results have been returned to the user as the left-most node is
still pending. Once the 'f1(f0(c0)[0])' sub-tree completes it's results
(along with the two that are buffered) will be returned in order.
