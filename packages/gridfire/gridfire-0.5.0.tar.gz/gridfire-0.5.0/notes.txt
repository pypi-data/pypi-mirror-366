The logical flow of using this installer is (for C++ usage): install system dependencies > "Run Full Build" > "Run Meson Install"
The logical flow of using this installer is (for Python usage): install system dependencies > "Install Python Bindings" (note this will take a while).
When building in release mode (default), static analysis of CppAD throws a few bounds warnings. Testing indicates that these are not problems. These warnings do not get identified in debug builds.
GridFire requires gcc >= 13.0.0 or clang >= 16.0.0
A directory named meson-boost-test will be created in the build directory. This is used to test the boost installation and may be deleted after the build is complete.
GridFire requires a version of boost compatible with C++23. Certain versions of Ubuntu prior released prior to 24.04 do not have a compatible version of boost in their repositories. In this case, you will need to install boost from source.
