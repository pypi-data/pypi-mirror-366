Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Create a Pricelist Item.
2. Add the product brands you want to include in the pricelist item.

Usage
=====

Usage Guide:

- Step 1: Create a New Pricelist

1. Go to the Sales app.
2. Navigate to Products > Pricelists.
3. Click on Create to create a new pricelist.
4. In field Brands, add the brands of the products to which this
   pricelist should apply. The prices defined in this pricelist will
   only apply to products that belong to one of the selected brands.

- Step 2: Create a New Sale Order

1. Go to the Sales app.
2. Click on Create to start a new sale order.
3. Select the Pricelist you just created, which includes the brands you
   assigned in the previous step.
4. Add the products to the sale order.

- Step 3: Check the Pricing Once the products are added to the sale
  order, the system will automatically check if each product belongs to
  one of the brands selected in the pricelist. If the product matches a
  selected brand, the pricing from the pricelist will be applied. If the
  product does not belong to any of the selected brands, the system will
  fall back to the default pricing for that product.
