2. Navigate to Products > Pricelists.
3. Click on Create to create a new pricelist.
4. In field Brands, add the brands of the products to which this pricelist should apply.
The prices defined in this pricelist will only apply to products that belong to one of the selected brands.

- Step 2: Create a New Sale Order
1. Go to the Sales app.
2. Click on Create to start a new sale order.
3. Select the Pricelist you just created, which includes the brands you assigned in the previous step.

- Step 3: Check the Pricing
Once the products are added to the sale order, the system will automatically check if each product belongs to one of the brands selected in the pricelist. If the product matches a selected brand, the pricing from the pricelist will be applied. If the product does not belong to any of the selected brands, the system will fall back to the default pricing for that product.
