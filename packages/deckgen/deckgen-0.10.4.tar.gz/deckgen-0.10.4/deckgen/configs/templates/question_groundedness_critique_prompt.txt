You will be given a context and a question.
Your task is to provide a 'total rating' scoring how well one can answer the given question unambiguously with the given context.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means that the question is not answerable at all given the context, and 5 means that the question is clearly and unambiguously answerable with the context.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 5)
You MUST follow the output format for the total rating exactly as shown.
