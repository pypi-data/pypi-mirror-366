-----

A lightweight development server for AWS Lambda, `lambda-dev-server` emulates the Lambda environment locally by creating events and contexts for any app handler. It processes requests, generates Lambda events, and returns parsed responsesâ€”ideal for development and debugging, with hot-reloading for rapid iteration. Not intended for production use. This has been tested with lambdas that use `aws-lambda-powertools` as well with lambdas that return in the shape of `{"statusCode": 200, "body": "Hello World"}`.

## Installation

To install `lambda-dev-server`, use pip:

```sh
pip install lambda-dev-server
```

## Usage

```bash
# Given a Lambda handler named handler in app.py
lambda-dev-server app.handler
```

## Debugging

You can configure your debugger in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the following `launch.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python Debugger: Module",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "lambda_dev_server",
      "args": ["app.handler"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 1. Traditional Development Flow (Without `lambda-dev-server`)

This diagram illustrates the development flow when using `sam start-api` or manually invoking the Lambda handler. While `sam start-api` allows using tools like Postman or curl.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant SAM as AWS SAM/Local API
    participant Lambda as AWS Lambda
    participant IDE as IDE/Debugger

    User->>SAM: Use `sam start-api` (Build App)
    SAM->>API: Start Local API (API Gateway)
    User->>API: Send Request (Postman or Curl)
    API->>Lambda: Forward Request to Lambda Handler
    Lambda->>Lambda: Process Event & Context
    Lambda->>API: Return Processed Response
    API->>User: Return Response to User

    Note over SAM: Requires Build Step & Template.yaml Updates
    Note over API, Lambda: No Hot Reloading, Debugger Not Attached
    Note over User: Can Use Postman or Curl with `sam start-api`
```

### Drawbacks:
- **Manual event preparation**: When calling the Lambda handler directly via `invoke`, users must manually create events.
- **Requires `sam start-api`**: Using `sam start-api` requires building the application and maintaining a `template.yaml` file.
- **No hot reloading**: Code changes require restarting the local API, making iteration slower.
- **No debugger attachment**: Debugging during development is more complex.

## 2. Invoke/Direct Handler Call Flow (Without `lambda-dev-server`)

This flow demonstrates the manual process involved when invoking or calling the Lambda handler directly. Users must manually construct the event before sending it to the Lambda function.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Lambda as AWS Lambda
    participant IDE as IDE/Debugger

    User->>User: Manually Construct Event
    User->>Lambda: Invoke or Call Lambda Handler Directly
    Lambda->>Lambda: Process Event & Context (Handler Logic)
    Lambda->>User: Return Processed Response
    User->>User: View Response

    Note over User: Must Manually Create Event
    Note over Lambda: No API Gateway or Automatic Event Simulation
    Note over IDE: No Hot Reloading or Debugger Attach in this Flow
```

### Drawbacks:
- **Manual event construction**: The user has to manually create the event, which is error-prone and cumbersome.
- **No API Gateway**: The flow lacks the built-in API Gateway to handle routing and automatic event creation.
- **No hot reloading or debugger**: Users cannot easily attach a debugger or take advantage of hot reloading in this flow.

## 3. Improved Flow with `lambda-dev-server`

This flow illustrates the seamless experience provided by `lambda-dev-server`. With no build steps, hot reloading, and easy event simulation, development becomes faster and easier.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Server as Lambda Dev Server
    participant Lambda as AWS Lambda Handler
    participant IDE as IDE/Debugger

    User->>Server: Run `lambda-dev-server` with Handler
    Server->>Server: Start Web Server (Uvicorn/WSGI)
    User->>Server: Send Request (Postman or Curl)
    Server->>Server: Simulate Lambda Event & Context
    Server->>Lambda: Call Lambda Handler with Event & Context
    Lambda->>Lambda: Process Event & Context (Handler Logic)
    Lambda->>Server: Return Response
    Server->>User: Return HTTP Response

    Note over Server: No Build Step Required
    Note over Server: Hot Reloading on Code Changes
    Note over IDE: Attachable Debugger
    Note over User: Use Postman or Curl to Call API
```

### Benefits:
- **No build step**: Directly run the Lambda handler through a web server, bypassing the need to build the application.
- **Hot-reloading**: Changes to the code are reflected immediately, speeding up the development process.
- **Debugger attachment**: Easily attach a debugger to the running server for troubleshooting.
- **Automatic event simulation**: The server handles event creation and Lambda context simulation, saving time.
- **Seamless interaction**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test the handler just like a regular REST API.

---

## Conclusion

`lambda-dev-server` significantly improves the AWS Lambda development experience by allowing you to:
- Avoid the need for build steps and maintaining `template.yaml`.
- Use Postman or curl just like in regular REST API development.
- Enjoy hot reloading and easy debugging for rapid iteration.
