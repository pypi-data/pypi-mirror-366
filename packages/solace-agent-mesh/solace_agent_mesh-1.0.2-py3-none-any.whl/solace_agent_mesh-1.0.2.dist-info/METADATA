              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Solace Agent Mesh transforms how AI agents work together, creating a dynamic ecosystem where specialized agents communicate seamlessly, share information, and collaborate on complex tasks.

Built on Solace PubSub+ Event Broker, this framework provides a robust foundation for enterprise-grade AI solutions that scale effortlessly. The mesh creates a standardized communication layer where AI agents can:

* Delegate specialized tasks to peer agents
* Share artifacts and data across the network
* Connect with diverse user interfaces and external systems
* Execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal coupling

Under the hood, the framework combines the Solace AI Connector (SAC) for runtime orchestration with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for agent logic, LLM interaction, and tool execution—all communicating via the A2A protocol over Solace's event mesh. The result? A fully asynchronous, event-driven, and decoupled AI agent architecture ready for enterprise deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Solace Agent Mesh provides a "Universal A2A Agent Host," a flexible and configurable runtime environment built by integrating Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with the Solace AI Connector (SAC) framework.

The system allows you to:

- Host AI agents developed with Google ADK within the SAC framework
- Define agent capabilities (LLM model, instructions, tools) primarily through SAC YAML configuration
- Utilize Solace PubSub+ as the transport for standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol communication
- Enable dynamic discovery of peer agents running within the same ecosystem
- Allow agents to delegate tasks to discovered peers via the A2A protocol over Solace
- Manage file artifacts using built-in tools with automatic metadata injection
- Perform data analysis using built-in SQL, JQ, and visualization tools
- Use dynamic embeds for context-dependent information resolution

### Key Components

- **SAC** handles broker connections, configuration loading, and component lifecycle
- **ADK** provides the agent runtime, LLM interaction, tool execution, and state management
- **A2A Protocol** enables communication between clients and agents, and between peer agents
- **Dynamic Embeds** allow placeholders in responses that are resolved with context-dependent information
- **File Management** provides built-in tools for artifact creation, listing, loading, and metadata handling
