# Algebrix
--- 

**Algebrix** is a simple and powerful library for working with vectors and matrices. Supports basic linear algebra operations, including:

* Addition, subtraction, scalar and matrix multiplication

* Normalization of vectors, calculation of angle, projections

* Transpose, inverse matrix, reshape

* And much more

## Installing
```bash
pip install algebrix
```

## Usage examples
```python
from algebrix import Matrix, Vector

# –í–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã
v1 = Vector([1, 2, 3])
v2 = Vector([4, 5, 6])

print(v1 + v2)             # Vector([5, 7, 9])
print(v1.dot(v2))          # 32
print(v1.norm())           # 3.741...
print(v1.project_onto(v2)) # –ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è v1 –Ω–∞ v2

# –ú–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü—ã
m1 = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
m2 = Matrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(m1 + m2)             # Matrix([[6, 8], [10, 12]])
print(m1 * m2)             # Matrix([[19, 22], [43, 50]])
print(m1.T())              # Matrix([[1, 3], [2, 4]])
print(m1.inverse())        # Matrix([[-2.0, 1.0], [1.5, -0.5]])

```
