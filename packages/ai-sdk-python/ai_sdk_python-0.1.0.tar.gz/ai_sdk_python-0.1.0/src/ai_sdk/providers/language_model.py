    A *language model* encapsulates a specific model on a provider (e.g. the
    GPT-4o model on OpenAI).  Each concrete implementation must expose a
    synchronous *generate_text* convenience as well as a *stream_text*
    generator that yields incremental text deltas.  The exact signature is
    intentionally kept very loose to remain provider-agnostic â€“ callers should
    go through the top-level ``ai_sdk.generate_text`` / ``ai_sdk.stream_text``
    helpers instead of invoking the provider directly.
