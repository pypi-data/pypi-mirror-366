## Prerequisites

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the recommended way to install and use this server. Here are quick one-liners to install it if you haven't:

- **Windows**: (run as administrator)

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

- **Unix**:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

More on [installing `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

The package is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/librespsrite-mcp/), so feel free to consume it any other way you prefer (`pipx`, etc)

## Usage

### Step 1: Setting up the client

Add the MCP server with the following entrypoint command (or something else if you are not using `uv`) to your MCP client:

```bash
uvx libresprite-mcp
```

#### Examples:

- **Claude Desktop & Cursor**

    Edit _Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json_ or _.cursor > mcp.json_ to include the server:
    
    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            // ...existing servers...
            "libresprite": {
                "type": "stdio",
                "command": "uvx",
    			"args": [
    				"libresprite-mcp"
    			]
            }
            // ...existing servers...
        }
    }
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> You will have to restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP Server.

### Step 2: Setting up LibreSprite

Download the latest stable remote script `mcp.js` from [releases](https://github.com/Snehil-Shah/libresprite-mcp/releases/latest) and add it to LibreSprite's scripts folder:

![scripts-folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snehil-Shah/libresprite-mcp/main/assets/scripts-folder.png)

### Step 3: Connect and use

Run the `mcp.js` script (that you see in the screenshot above), and make sure your MCP server is running (Claude Desktop/Cursor is loaded and running). If all went well, you should see the following screen:

![connect-button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snehil-Shah/libresprite-mcp/main/assets/connect.png)

Click the "Connect" button and you can now start talking to Claude about your next big pixel-art project!

## Some pointers

- You can only run one instance of the MCP server at a time.
- The server expects port `64823` to be free.
- The server has a hacky and brittle implementation (see [ARCHITECTURE](https://github.com/Snehil-Shah/libresprite-mcp/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)), and is not extensively tested.
- The MCP resources are kinda low quality with unclear API reference and limited examples, leaving the LLM confused at times. If you're a LibreSprite expert, we need your help.
