bowtie [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A meta-validator for the JSON Schema specifications.

  Bowtie gives you access to JSON Schema across every programming language and
  implementation.

  It lets you compare implementations to each other, or to known correct
  results from the JSON Schema test suite.

  If you don't know where to begin, ``bowtie validate`` (for checking what any
  given implementations think of your schema) or ``bowtie suite`` (for running
  the official test suite against implementations) are likely good places to
  start.

  Full documentation can also be found at https://docs.bowtie.report

Options:
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  -L, --log-level [debug|info|warning|error|critical]
                                  How verbose should Bowtie be?  [default:
                                  (warning)]
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  badges    Generate Bowtie badges from previous runs.
  info      Retrieve a particular implementation (harness)'s metadata.
  run       Run a sequence of cases provided on standard input.
  smoke     Smoke test one or more implementations for basic correctness.
  suite     Run test cases from the official JSON Schema test suite.
  summary   Generate an (in-terminal) summary of a Bowtie run.
  validate  Validate one or more instances under a given schema across...

Examples:

  $ bowtie validate -i js-ajv -i js-hyperjump <(printf '{"type": "integer"}') <(printf 37) <(printf '"foo"')

    Given some collection of implementations to check - here perhaps two Javascript implementations - it takes a single schema and one or more instances to check against it.

  $ bowtie suite -i lua-jsonschema https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/blob/main/tests/draft7/type.json | bowtie summary --show failures

    Run a specific file from the draft 7 official test suite against a single implementation.

  $ bowtie suite $(bowtie filter-implementations | sed 's/^/-i /') https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/tree/main/tests/draft7 | bowtie summary --show failures

    Run the entire draft 2020-12 test suite against all implementations which support it.
