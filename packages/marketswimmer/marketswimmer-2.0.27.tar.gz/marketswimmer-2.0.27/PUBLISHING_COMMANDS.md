2. **v2.0.2**: GUI "Complete Analysis" error from trying to run non-existent `analyze_ticker_gui.py`
   - **Root Cause**: Packaged GUI still had old script reference
   - **Solution**: Updated `marketswimmer/gui/main_window.py` to use `python -m marketswimmer analyze`
3. **v2.0.3**: "No module named marketswimmer.__main__" error when GUI tries to execute CLI
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `__main__.py` file for module execution
   - **Solution**: Added `marketswimmer/__main__.py` to enable `python -m marketswimmer` execution
4. **v2.0.5**: Windows Unicode encoding errors and GUI missing file errors
   - **Root Cause**: Unicode emoji characters incompatible with Windows cp1252 encoding
   - **Solution**: Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII equivalents, fixed GUI to use modern CLI commands

   - **Root Cause**: Additional emoji characters (🔄, 🎉, 📁, ⚠️, 1️⃣-4️⃣) still causing Windows encoding issues
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive removal of ALL emoji characters, replaced with ASCII text equivalents
6. **v2.0.7**: Repository cleanup and clean republish
   - **Goal**: Professional package without development artifacts
   - **Action**: Removed test directories, build artifacts, and temporary files for clean distribution
7. **v2.0.8**: Final Unicode compatibility fix
   - **Root Cause**: Remaining Unicode characters (🌐, ⏳, ❌, 💡, 📋, ✅) and Rich spinner characters causing Windows cp1252 encoding errors
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive replacement of ALL Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents throughout entire codebase
   - **Result**: Complete Windows terminal compatibility across all encoding systems

### ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**: 
- Some dependencies (typer, rich) may not auto-install from PyPI
- **Workaround**: Manually install with `pip install typer rich` after installing MarketSwimmer
- **Python Path Issue**: If using multiple Python installations, specify the full path:
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m pip install typer rich`
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m marketswimmer gui`
- **Status**: All Unicode encoding issues resolved in v2.0.8

### 🚀 **Clean Installation & Testing**:
For a completely clean test environment:

**Option 1: Use the automated script**
```bash
# Run the batch file for automated clean installation
