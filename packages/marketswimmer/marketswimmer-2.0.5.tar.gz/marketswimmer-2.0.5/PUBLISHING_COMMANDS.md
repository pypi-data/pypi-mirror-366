### 🚨 **ISSUES RESOLVED**: 
1. **v2.0.1**: Missing calculation methods causing workflow failures
2. **v2.0.2**: GUI "Complete Analysis" error from trying to run non-existent `analyze_ticker_gui.py`
   - **Root Cause**: Packaged GUI still had old script reference
   - **Solution**: Updated `marketswimmer/gui/main_window.py` to use `python -m marketswimmer analyze`
3. **v2.0.3**: "No module named marketswimmer.__main__" error when GUI tries to execute CLI
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `__main__.py` file for module execution
   - **Solution**: Added `marketswimmer/__main__.py` to enable `python -m marketswimmer` execution

### ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**: 
- Some dependencies (typer, rich) may not auto-install from PyPI
- **Workaround**: Manually install with `pip install typer rich` after installing MarketSwimmer
- **Python Path Issue**: If using multiple Python installations, specify the full path:
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m pip install typer rich`
  - `C:\Users\jerem\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m marketswimmer gui`
- **Status**: Investigating dependency resolution for future release

### 🚀 **Clean Installation & Testing**:
For a completely clean test environment:

**Option 1: Use the automated script**
```bash
# Run the batch file for automated clean installation
clean_install_test.bat

# Or use PowerShell version
clean_install_test.ps1
```

**Option 2: Manual clean installation**
```bash
# 1. Uninstall any existing versions
pip uninstall marketswimmer -y

# 2. Create fresh virtual environment
python -m venv marketswimmer_clean_test

# 3. Install in virtual environment
marketswimmer_clean_test\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install marketswimmer==2.0.4

# 4. Test the installation
marketswimmer_clean_test\Scripts\python.exe -m marketswimmer gui
```

### 🚀 **Quick Launch Options**:
1. **Use the automated test script**: `clean_install_test.bat` (complete clean installation and testing)
2. **Use the batch file**: `launch_gui.bat` (handles Python path automatically)
3. **Install dependencies first**: `pip install typer rich PyQt6` then `python -m marketswimmer gui`
4. **Use specific Python path** (if multiple Python versions installed)
5. **Virtual environment** (recommended for testing): Use the clean installation scripts above

# 1. Upload to Test PyPI first
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# 2. Test installation from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ marketswimmer

# 3. If everything works, upload to production PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*

# 4. Install from production PyPI
pip install marketswimmer

# 5. Install required dependencies (if not automatically installed):
pip install typer rich matplotlib PyQt6

# 6. For full GUI functionality, install all optional dependencies:
pip install matplotlib PyQt6 seaborn

# 7. Test the installation:
python -m marketswimmer --help
