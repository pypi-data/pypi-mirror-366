              copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish,
              distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to
              permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to
              the following conditions:
        
              The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
              included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.

              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
              charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or other liability
              obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
              accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
              on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
              and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
              harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
              such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
              support.

## ✨ Key Features

### Autonomous Memory Management System

![features](./assets/workflow.png)

### **Organize** - Autonomous Memory Management
Your memories are structured as intelligent folders managed by a dedicated memory agent. We do not do explicit modeling for memories. The memory agent automatically decides what to record, modify, or archive based on relevance and usage patterns. Think of it as having a personal librarian who knows exactly how to organize your thoughts.

### **Link** - Interconnected Knowledge Graph
Memories don't exist in isolation. Our system automatically creates meaningful connections between related memories, building a rich network of hyperlinked documents. As your knowledge base grows, so does the web of relationships, making information discovery intuitive and contextual.

### **Evolve** - Continuous Self-Improvement
Even when offline, your memory system keeps working. It generates new insights by analyzing existing memories, identifies patterns, and creates summary documents through self-reflection. Your knowledge base becomes smarter over time, not just larger.

### **Never Forget** - Intelligent Retention System
We've revolutionized memory persistence with a dynamic importance algorithm. Recently referenced memories gain higher priority, ensuring that what matters most to you now stays readily accessible. The system adapts to your changing needs, keeping relevant information at your fingertips while gracefully archiving what's no longer critical.

---

## 🤫 Advantages

### Higher Memory Accuracy
MemU achieves 92.09% average accuracy across all reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming competitors. Techical Report will be published soon!

![Memory Accuracy Comparison](assets/benchmark.png)

### Flexible Retrieval Strategies

MemU provides a comprehensive suite of retrieval strategies, allowing you to choose the optimal approach for your specific scenario. From semantic similarity to category search, our flexible system adapts to your needs.

### Human-Readable & Analyzable Memory Architecture

Unlike other memory frameworks that store information as fragmented sentences, MemU organizes memories as coherent, readable documents while simultaneously transforming raw data into structured, analyzable datasets. While competitors break down information into scattered fragments, MemU maintains complete context and relationships, enabling easy debugging, manual editing, seamless analytics, and effortless integration with existing workflows.
