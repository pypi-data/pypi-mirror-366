NOTICE: Symbolic and Theoretical Origins

Cognize is a symbolic cognition wrapper designed for epistemic drift awareness and rupture detection.

This package is inspired in part by an epistemic control framework developed in 2025 by Pulikanti Sashi Bharadwaj.

The system's architecture draws on ideas of recursive projection, misalignment memory, and symbolic rupture â€” originally formulated in a research exploration of epistemic control and dynamic belief regulation.
