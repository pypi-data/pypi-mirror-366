# ðŸ“¢ What's New (June 2025)

**ezscore-f just got even better.**  
We've updated the model training pipeline to include **custom loss functions targeting class imbalance**, improving performance in minority classes such as **N1 sleep**.

The image below shows the updated model's confusion matrix on the same test set used in our original evaluation (Coon et al., 2025):

> **Figure**: Confusion matrix of the updated ezscore-f model, `ez6`.  `ez6` is the best-performing version of the model to-date.
> Notably improved classification of N1 sleep and better artifact separation, following the integration of custom loss functions during training.

# Install

### Install Python environment / package manager 
We use the `uv` package manager (you can skip this step if you already use `uv`).  You can find full install documentation here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

For macOS and linux, you can use `curl` to download the script and execute it with sh:

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

For Windows, you can use `powershell`:

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

### Install ezscore
Once you have `uv` installed, you can install `ezscore-f` from Terminal after navigating to the directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coonwg1/ezscore.git
cd ezscore

uv venv
uv pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Test Installation
You can test the installation by running the demo script from a Terminal window like this:
```bash
python ezscore_demo.py
```

If everything installed correctly, the script should open a new figure window with a plot that looks like this:

</p>

And below are the "ground truth" sleep stages derived from concurrently recorded PSG and consensus scoring by multiple trained experts.

## Troubleshooting 

If you encounter an issue installing ezscore on your machine, let us know!  Or, peruse these helpful notes from user community feedback we have received already:

**`uv` issues**
- Users who already use `uv` may be familiar with other `uv` syntax for setting up an encapsulated Python environment, like `uv sync`.  Some users of macOS machines have noted issues with tensorflow dependencies during installation when using `uv sync` instead of the two lines we suggest in our install instructions (`uv venv` followed by `uv pip install -e .`).  To address this issue, try the installation again using our instructions (do not use `uv sync`).
- The most frequently reported errors during install can be addressed by increasing the timeout limit for uv: From a Terminal, run:
```bash 
export UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=999
```
and then try the installation again.
