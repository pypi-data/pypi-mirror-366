# Vessim

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vessim.svg?color=52c72b)](https://pypi.org/project/vessim/)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/vessim.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/vessim/)
[![Supported versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/vessim.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/vessim/)

Vessim is a **co-simulation testbed for carbon-aware systems** that allows you to simulate how your computing systems interact with local renewable energy sources, battery storage, and the public grid.
It connects domain-specific simulators for power generation and energy storage with **real software and hardware**.


## What can I do with Vessim?

Vessim helps you to understand and optimize how your (distributed) computing system interacts with (distributed) renewable energy sources and battery storage.

- **Carbon-aware applications**: Develop applications that automatically reduce their energy consumption when the grid is powered by fossil fuels, and increase activity when renewable energy is abundant.
- **Energy system composition**: Experiment with adding solar panels, wind turbines, or batteries to see how they would affect your energy costs and carbon emissions.
- **Plan for outages and extreme events**: Simulate power outages or renewable energy fluctuations to understand risks and test backup strategies.
- **Quality assurance**: Apply Vessim in continuous integrating testing to validate software roll-outs in a controlled environment.

Vessim can run simulations faster than real-time, includes historical datasets for realistic scenarios, and can simulate multiple microgrids in parallel. 
You can test scenarios using historical data or connect real applications and hardware to simulated energy systems.

**Check out the official [documentation](https://vessim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!**


## Simple scenario

The scenario below simulates a microgrid consisting of a simulated computing system (which consistently draws 700W), 
a single producer (a solar power plant who's production is modelled based on a dataset provided by [Solcast](https://solcast.com/)), and a battery. 
The *Monitor* periodically stores the energy system state in a CSV file.

```python
import vessim as vs

environment = vs.Environment(sim_start="2022-06-15", step_size=300)  # 5 minute step size

microgrid = environment.add_microgrid(
    name="datacenter",
    actors=[
        vs.Actor(name="server", signal=vs.StaticSignal(value=-700)),  # negative = consumes power
        vs.Actor(name="solar_panel", signal=vs.Trace.load("solcast2022_global", column="Berlin", params={"scale": 5000})),  # 5kW maximum
    ],
    storage=vs.SimpleBattery(capacity=100),
)

# Write results to CSV
monitor = vs.Monitor([microgrid], outfile="./results.csv")
environment.add_controller(monitor)

environment.run(until=24 * 3600)  # 24h simulated time
```


## Software-in-the-loop scenario

Vessim can simulate the energy systems of real applications and hardware.
The following example 

1. pulls energy consumption data from a Prometheus monitoring system
2. exposes the simulated microgrid via a REST API, including the current marginal carbon intensity of the public grid (provided by [Watttime](https://watttime.org/)).

```python
import vessim as vs

environment = vs.Environment(sim_start="2022-06-15", step_size=5)  # 5 second step size

microgrid = environment.add_microgrid(
    name=f"gpu_cluster_in_berlin",
    actors=[
        vs.Actor(name="gpu_cluster", signal=vs.PrometheusSignal(
            prometheus_url="http://localhost:30826/prometheus",
            query=f"sum(DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE)",  # sum of all GPUs' power consumption
            username="username",
            password="xxxxxxxxxx"
        ))
    ],
    grid_signals={"mci_index": vs.WatttimeSignal(
        username="username",
        password="xxxxxxxxxx",
        location=(52.5200, 13.4050),  # Berlin coordinates
    )},
)

rest_api = vs.Api([microgrid], export_prometheus=True)
environment.add_controller(rest_api)

environment.run(until=24 * 3600, rt_factor=1)  # 24h in real-time mode
```


## Installation

You can install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/vessim/) of Vessim
via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```
pip install vessim
```

If you require software-in-the-loop (SiL) capabilities, you should additionally install the `sil` extension:

```
pip install vessim[sil]
```


## Work in progress

Our team at the [Distributed and Operating Systems](https://distributedsystems.berlin/) group at TU Berlin is actively working to improve Vessim.
We are currently working on the following aspects and features:

- **Vessim X Exalsius**: We are working on integrating Vessim into [Exalsius](https://www.exalsius.ai/)' GPU provisioning and scheduling.
- **Vessim X Flower**: We are working on integrating Vessim into the federated learning framework [Flower](https://flower.ai).
- **Vessim X Vidur**: We are working on integrating Vessim into the LLM simulator [Vidur](https://github.com/microsoft/vidur).
- **System Advisor Model (SAM)**: We are working on integrating NREL's [SAM](https://sam.nrel.gov/) as a subsystem in Vessim, allowing for better simulation of solar arrays, wind farms, and other types of renewable energy generators.
- **Battery degradation**: We are working on integrating NREL's [BLAST-Lite](https://github.com/NREL/BLAST-Lite) for modeling battery lifetime and degradation
- **Calibration**: We are working on a methodology for calibrating Vessim simulations on real hardware testbeds.


## Datasets
