# Go-to-Market Manifesto - TaskPriority AI MCP Server

## 1. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

We focus on **technical solo founders and developer-entrepreneurs** who are already using TaskPriority AI and want deeper integration with their AI-powered development workflow:

- **Power users of TaskPriority AI** who have 50+ tasks/feedback items and want programmatic access to their prioritization system
- **AI-native developers** using Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, or similar AI coding assistants that support MCP protocol
- **Automation enthusiasts** who want to connect their task prioritization with other tools (Zapier, Make, n8n) via MCP bridges
- **Technical founders** building developer tools, SaaS products, or APIs who understand the value of programmatic interfaces
- **Company profile**: Same as core product (solo founders, 0-1 employees, $0-50K MRR) but with higher technical sophistication

These users are already saving 5-10 hours/week with TaskPriority AI but want to eliminate the last friction points by integrating task management directly into their AI coding environment.

## 2. Current Workflow & Pain Points

**Current Painful Workflow:**
Even with TaskPriority AI, technical founders still face **2-3 hours/week** of context switching:

- Alt-tab between Claude/Cursor and TaskPriority AI web interface
- Manually copy task details and AI prompts between applications
- Break flow state to update task status after implementation
- Lose context when switching between coding and task management
- Cannot automate task creation from other tools (GitHub issues, customer emails)
- No way to bulk process or script task operations

**Core Pain Points:**

- **Context switching overhead**: Each switch between coding and task management breaks flow state (23 minutes to refocus)
- **Manual data transfer**: Copy-pasting between AI assistant and TaskPriority AI
- **Lack of automation**: Cannot programmatically create tasks from webhooks or scripts
- **No IDE integration**: Task context not available where developers actually work

**Value Proposition:**
"The **TaskPriority AI MCP Server** helps **developer-founders using AI coding assistants** by helping them **manage tasks directly from their AI environment, eliminating context switching and enabling powerful automations that save an additional 3 hours per week**."

## 3. Price

**Value Calculation:**

- Eliminates 2-3 hours/week of context switching
- Developer hourly value: $100-150/hour
- Weekly value created: $200-450
- Monthly value: $800-1,800

**Pricing Strategy:**

- **Free for existing customers**: Included with Professional ($49/mo) and Growth ($99/mo) plans
- **Standalone MCP access**: $19/month for API-only access (no web UI)
- **Usage limits**: 1,000 API calls/month on Professional, unlimited on Growth
- **Open source option**: Self-hosted version available for free (no support)

This pricing rewards loyalty while creating an entry point for developers who only want API access.
