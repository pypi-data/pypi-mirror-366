# Development Plan - TaskPriority AI MCP Server

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step development plan for implementing the TaskPriority AI MCP Server. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a production-ready MCP server.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

### 1.1 Environment Setup & Configuration
- [x] Create `.env.example` file with required environment variables
- [x] Implement `config.py` module for configuration management
  - Load environment variables using python-dotenv
  - Define configuration classes with Pydantic
  - Validate API key format (must start with `tp_live_`)
  - Support both development and production URLs
- [x] Set up logging infrastructure with appropriate log levels
- [x] Create development helper scripts (start server, run tests, etc.)

### 1.2 Data Models
- [x] Implement `models.py` with Pydantic models:
  - `Task` model matching API response structure
  - `AIAnalysis` model for AI analysis data
  - `TaskStatus` enum (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
  - `TaskCategory` enum (bug, feature, improvement, business, other)
  - Request/response models for each MCP tool
- [x] Add model validation and serialization logic
- [x] Create comprehensive docstrings for all models

### 1.3 API Client Foundation
- [x] Implement `priority_client.py` with async HTTP client:
  - Initialize httpx.AsyncClient with connection pooling
  - Base configuration (timeouts, headers, retries)
  - Request/response logging for debugging
  - Generic request method with error handling
- [x] Implement `auth.py` for authentication:
  - API key validation logic
  - Bearer token header construction
