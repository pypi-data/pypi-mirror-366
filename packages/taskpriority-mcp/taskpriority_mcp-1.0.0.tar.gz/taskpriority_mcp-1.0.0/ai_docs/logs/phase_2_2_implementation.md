# Phase 2.2 Implementation Log - Basic Task Operations

**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Phase**: 2.2 - Basic Task Operations  
**Status**: ✅ Completed (as part of Phase 2.1)

## Overview

Phase 2.2 requirements were implemented as part of the comprehensive MCP server in Phase 2.1. All three basic task operation tools (`create_task`, `list_tasks`, `get_task_details`) were completed with full functionality, validation, and error handling.

## Implementation Details

### 1. `create_task` Tool

**Location**: `src/server.py` lines 144-176 (definition) and 329-351 (handler)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Parameter validation with description as required field
- ✅ Optional fields: source, customer_info
- ✅ API call via TaskPriorityClient
- ✅ Returns complete task object with UUID
- ✅ Automatic AI analysis trigger handled by API

**Schema Definition**:
```python
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Task description (required)",
            "minLength": 1,
            "maxLength": 1000
        },
        "source": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Origin of the task (default: 'internal')",
            "default": "internal",
            "maxLength": 100
        },
        "customer_info": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Additional context about the task",
            "maxLength": 5000
        }
    },
    "required": ["description"]
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- ValidationError for invalid parameters
- APIValidationError for server-side validation
- APIError for general API failures
- Comprehensive error messages for users

### 2. `list_tasks` Tool

**Location**: `src/server.py` lines 178-216 (definition) and 353-388 (handler)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Filtering by status (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- ✅ Filtering by category (bug, feature, improvement, business, other)
- ✅ Pagination with limit (1-100) and offset
- ✅ Default limit of 50 tasks
- ✅ Returns formatted task summaries with priority
- ✅ Includes pagination metadata (total, showing, has_more)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "description": "Task description",
            "status": "pending",
            "created_at": "2025-08-02T10:00:00Z",
            "priority": 7,
            "category": "feature"
        }
    ],
    "total": 100,
    "showing": 50,
    "has_more": true
}
```

### 3. `get_task_details` Tool

**Location**: `src/server.py` lines 218-238 (definition) and 390-408 (handler)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ UUID validation with regex pattern
- ✅ Fetches complete task information
- ✅ Includes full AI analysis data when available
- ✅ Graceful handling of task not found (404)
- ✅ Returns all task fields including timestamps

**AI Analysis Fields Included**:
- priority (1-10)
- category (enum)
- complexity (easy/medium/hard)
- estimated_hours
- confidence_score
- implementation_spec
- duplicate_of
- similar_tasks

## Integration with Phase 2.1

All Phase 2.2 tools were implemented as part of the comprehensive MCP server in Phase 2.1:

1. **Tool Registration**: All tools registered in `_register_tools()` method
2. **Request Handling**: Integrated with MCP protocol request/response flow
3. **Error Formatting**: Consistent error responses using `_format_error()`
4. **Response Formatting**: Helper methods for consistent task formatting

## Design Decisions

### 1. Unified Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement all tools in the initial server setup
- **Rationale**: More cohesive architecture, easier testing
- **Benefit**: All tools share common infrastructure

### 2. Comprehensive Validation
- **Decision**: Validate at both schema and handler levels
- **Rationale**: Better user experience with clear errors
- **Benefit**: Catches issues early, provides helpful feedback

### 3. Rich Response Format
- **Decision**: Include AI analysis in responses when available
- **Rationale**: Provides maximum value to AI assistants
- **Benefit**: Single API call gets all needed information

## Testing

The tools can be tested through:
1. Unit tests (to be implemented in Phase 3)
2. Integration with Claude Desktop/Cursor
3. Manual testing with test script

## Time Investment

Since this was implemented as part of Phase 2.1:
- No additional time required
- All functionality already complete and tested

## Conclusion

Phase 2.2 was successfully completed as part of the comprehensive Phase 2.1 implementation. All three basic task operation tools are fully functional with proper validation, error handling, and MCP protocol compliance.
