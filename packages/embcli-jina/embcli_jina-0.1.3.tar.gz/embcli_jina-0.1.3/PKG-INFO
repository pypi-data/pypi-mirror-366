jina plugin for embcli, a command-line interface for embeddings.

## Reference

- [Jina Models](https://jina.ai/models)

## Installation

```bash
pip install embcli-jina
```

## Quick Start

You need Jina API key to use this plugin. Set `JINA_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file in the current directory. Or you can give the env file path by `-e` option.

```bash
cat .env
JINA_API_KEY=<YOUR_JINA_KEY>
```

### Try out the Embedding Models

```bash
# show general usage of emb command.
emb --help

# list all available models.
emb models
JinaEmbeddingModel
    Vendor: jina
    Models:
    * jina-embeddings-v3 (aliases: jina-v3)
    * jina-colbert-v2 (aliases: colbert-v2)
    * jina-embeddings-v2-base-code (aliases: jina-v2-code)
    Model Options:
    * task (str) - Downstream task for which the embeddings are used. Supported tasks: 'text-matching', 'retrieval.query', 'retrieval.passage', 'separation', 'classification'. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v3.
    * late_chunking (bool) - Whether if the late chunking is applied. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v3.
    * truncate (bool) - When enabled, the model will automatically drop the tail that extends beyond the maximum context length allowed by the model instead of throwing an error. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v3.
    * dimensions (int) - The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v3 and jina-colbert-v2.
    * input_type (str) - The type of input to the model. Supported types: 'query', 'document' Only supported in jina-corebert-v2.
    * embedding_type (str) - The type of embeddings to return. Options include 'float', 'binary', 'ubinary'. Default is 'float'.
JinaMultiModalModel
    Vendor: jina
    Models:
    * jina-embeddings-v4 (aliases: jina-v4)
    * jina-clip-v2 (aliases: )
    Model Options:
    * task (str) - Downstream task for which the embeddings are used. Supported tasks: 'retrieval.query', 'retrieval.passage', 'text-matching', 'code.query', 'code.passage'.
    * late_chunking (bool) - Whether if the late chunking is applied. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v4.
    * truncate (bool) - When enabled, the model will automatically drop the tail that extends beyond the maximum context length allowed by the model instead of throwing an error. Only supported in jina-embeddings-v4.
    * dimensions (int) - The number of dimensions the resulting output embeddings should have.
    * embedding_type (str) - The type of embeddings to return. Options include 'float', 'binary', 'ubinary'. Default is 'float'.

# get an embedding for an input text by jina-embeddings-v3 model.
emb embed -m jina-v3 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input text by jina-embeddings-v3 model model with dimensions=512.
emb embed -m jina-v3 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o dimensions 512

# get an embedding for an input text by jina-embeddings-v3 model model with embedding_type=binary.
emb embed -m jina-v3 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o embedding_type binary

# get an embedding for an image input by jina-embeddings-v4 model.
# assume you have an image file named `gingercat.jpg` in the current directory.
emb embed -m jina-v4 --image gingercat.jpeg

# calculate similarity score between two texts by jina-embeddings-v3 model model. the default metric is cosine similarity.
emb simscore -m jina-v3 "The cat drifts toward sleep." "Sleep dances in the cat's eyes."

### Document Indexing and Search

You can use the `emb` command to index documents and perform search by an image. `emb` uses [`LanceDB`](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) for the default vector database.

```bash
# index example documents in the current directory.
emb ingest-sample -m jina-v3 -c catcafe --corpus cat-names-en

# or, you can give the path to your documents.
# the documents should be in a CSV file with two columns: id and text. the separator should be comma.
emb ingest -m jina-v3 -c catcafe -f <path-to-your-documents>

# search for a query in the indexed documents.
emb search -m jina-v3 -c catcafe -q "Who's the naughtiest one?"
