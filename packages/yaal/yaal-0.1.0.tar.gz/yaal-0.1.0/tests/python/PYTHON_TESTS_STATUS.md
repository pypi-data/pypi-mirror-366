# Python Tests Status

## Overview

The Python YAAL parser tests have been created with comprehensive coverage, but the current Lark grammar needs refinement to fully support all YAAL features.

## Test Results Summary

**✅ Passing Tests (40/51):**
- Basic parser initialization and functionality
- Simple key-value parsing (unquoted values)
- Simple statements (lines without colons)
- Shebang line parsing
- First colon rule implementation
- Basic nested structures
- Comments handling
- File parsing operations
- Validation methods

**❌ Failing Tests (11/51):**
- Quoted string values (double and triple quotes)
- Empty values after colons
- Brace blocks with quoted content
- Some multiline brace blocks

## Grammar Issues Identified

### 1. Quoted String Handling
The current grammar doesn't properly recognize quoted strings in value positions:
```
description: "this is quoted"  # Fails - quotes not recognized as values
```

### 2. Empty Value Support
Grammar expects content after colons:
```
empty_key:  # Fails - no content after colon
```

### 3. Brace Block Content
Quotes inside brace blocks are being tokenized incorrectly:
```
script: { echo "hello" }  # Fails - quotes inside braces cause issues
```

## Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Files Created:
1. **test_parser_basic.py** - Basic parsing functionality
2. **test_parser_advanced.py** - Advanced features (shebang, braces, nesting, strings)
3. **test_ast_extraction.py** - AST extraction and data structure tests
4. **test_edge_cases.py** - Edge cases and error handling
5. **test_integration.py** - Real-world examples and integration tests

### Test Fixtures:
- basic.yaal - Simple key-value pairs
- shebang.yaal - Shebang examples
- simple_statements.yaal - Simple statements
- keys_with_spaces.yaal - Keys containing spaces
- nested.yaal - Nested structures
- strings.yaal - Various string types
- brace_blocks.yaal - Brace block examples
- first_colon_rule.yaal - First colon rule examples
- polymorphic_lists.yaal - Mixed content lists
- comments.yaal - Comment examples

## Next Steps for Python Parser

### Grammar Improvements Needed:
1. **Fix quoted string recognition in values**
2. **Support empty values after colons**
3. **Improve brace block content handling**
4. **Better integration of string types**

### Current Working Features:
- ✅ Basic key-value parsing (unquoted)
- ✅ Simple statements
- ✅ Shebang lines
- ✅ First colon rule
- ✅ Basic nesting
- ✅ Comments
- ✅ File operations

### Features Needing Work:
- ❌ Quoted strings as values
- ❌ Empty values
- ❌ Complex brace blocks
- ❌ Triple-quoted strings

## Test Infrastructure

The test infrastructure is solid with:
- ✅ uv-based project management
- ✅ pytest configuration with coverage
- ✅ Comprehensive test fixtures
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Performance tests

## Recommendation

While the Python parser needs grammar refinement, the test infrastructure and basic functionality are working well. The C++ parser (which is working correctly) can serve as a reference for the expected behavior while the Python grammar is improved.
