    target_gene : Genes
        namedTuple that has fields for the chromosome and the start and end
        region of the target locus

    filter : Optional[Callable] = None
        Function that will be used to filter the provided segments. Default
        functions will either filter to segments containing the target locus
        or those that overlap

    ibd_vs : DataFrame
        dataframe representing all the potential vertices in the graph. Each
        vertex is a haplotype

    ibd_pd : DataFrame
        dataframe representing the pairwise segments. Each row is the pair ids
        and the length of the segment

    hapid_map : Dict[str, int]
        dictionary mapping the haplotype to a unique integer id

    all_haplotypes : List[str]
        list of all the different haplotypes in the IBD data

    haplotype_id : int = 0
        This value is used as the counter and is incremented as the program runs
