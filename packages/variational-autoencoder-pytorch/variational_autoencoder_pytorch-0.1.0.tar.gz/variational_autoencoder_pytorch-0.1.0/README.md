# variational-autoencoder-pytorch
A minimal PyTorch library for building variational autoencoders (VAEs) with fully connected latent heads. Designed for fast prototyping, it provides modular encoder-decoder components and handles μ/logσ² prediction out of the box. Ideal for researchers and developers who want clean, customizable VAE models without boilerplate.
