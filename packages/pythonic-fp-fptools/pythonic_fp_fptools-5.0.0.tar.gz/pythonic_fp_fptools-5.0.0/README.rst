Pythonic FP - Functional tools
==============================

PyPI project
`pythonic-fp.fptools
<https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp.fptools>`_.

Tools to aid with functional programming in Python yet still endeavoring to
remain Pythonic.

- Functions as first class objects
- Lazy (non-strict) function evaluation
- Maybe monad - representing a possible missing value
- Either monad - left bias either monad representing either a LEFT or RIGHT value
- State monad implementation

  - pure FP handling of state (the state monad)
  - Classic FP implementation

    - the monad encapsulates a state transformation, not a "state"

This PyPI project is part of of the grscheller
`pythonic-fp namespace projects
<https://github.com/grscheller/pythonic-fp/blob/main/README.md>`_

**Warning:** The maintainer intends to break out the first, forth and
fifth modules to their own repos sometime in the near future.
