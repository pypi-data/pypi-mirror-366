# We don't allow an error callback for mildly complicated reasons:
# In order to get the exception object in this coroutine (rather than just a `CancelledError`) then we would need to
# `yield from coro`. However that means the main loop would also not see `coro` and thus not be able to record its
# output. Any other `yield coro` calls (which may occur as we do not control where else `coro` is used) would just
# give `None`.
# We could find a way to finesse this (stick with just `yield` and attach the coroutine information to the cancelled
# error, so we can identify that this is 'our' error and that we should call our error callback) but at least right now
# we don't have a use-case.
def add_done_callback(coro: Coro[_T], success_callback: Callable[[_T], None]) -> Coro[_T]:
    """Wraps `coro` so that `success_callback` is called once it completes.

    This function is typically used as `yield {add_done_callback(...)}`.  Note the `{...}`, indicating that calling this
    in nonblocking fashion (otherwise you could just directly call the callback yourself).

    This allows for scheduling work in the background, along with behaviour once it completes.

    **Arguments:**

    - `coro`: the coroutine to wrap.
    - `success_callback`: if `coro` completes successfully then this will be called with a single argument, which is the
        output of `coro`.

    **Returns:**

    A coroutine that returns nothing.

    !!! Example

        ```python
        import tinyio

        def sleep(x):
            yield tinyio.sleep(x)
            return x

        def done_callback_demo():
            success_callback = lambda out: print(f"Done callback demo: {out}")
            yield {tinyio.add_done_callback(sleep(2), success_callback)}
            yield {tinyio.add_done_callback(sleep(1), success_callback)}
            print("Hello")

        loop = tinyio.Loop()
        loop.run(done_callback_demo())
        # Hello
        # Done callback demo: 1
        # Done callback demo: 2
