# Scalable Directory Structure Implementation

## Summary
Reorganized circuit-synth source structure from chip-specific directories to a scalable, extensible architecture supporting multiple chip families and manufacturers.

## Key Changes
- **Moved STM32 integration**: `stm32_pinout/` → `chips/microcontrollers/stm32/`
- **Moved JLCPCB integration**: `jlc_integration/` → `manufacturing/jlcpcb/`
- **Created chip family structure**: `chips/{microcontrollers,analog,power,rf}/`
- **Created manufacturing structure**: `manufacturing/{jlcpcb,pcbway,oshpark,digikey}/`
- **Updated all import references** in hooks and validation code
- **Added comprehensive documentation** in CLAUDE.md

## New Structure Benefits
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new chip families (ESP32, PIC, AVR)
- **Extensible**: Clear path for new manufacturers (PCBWay, Digi-Key, OSH Park)
- **Organized**: Logical separation by chip type and manufacturing capability
- **Future-ready**: Placeholder modules guide future development

## Impact
Repository now supports unlimited chip families and manufacturers with clear organizational patterns. Claude Code agents can easily reference new integrations as they're added.
