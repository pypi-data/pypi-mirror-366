# Circuit-Synth Agent Development - 2025-07-27

## Overview
Completed development of specialized Claude agent for circuit-synth code review and guidance.

## Completed Work

### 1. Circuit-Synth Agent Creation
**Location:** `.claude/agents/circuit-synth.md`

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive syntax examples with ✅ good and ❌ bad patterns
- Component definition and reuse best practices
- Circuit structure guidance (@circuit decorator usage)
- Net management and naming conventions
- Pin connection patterns (integer vs string access)
- Code quality and maintainability standards

### 2. Documentation Updates
**README.md Enhancements:**
- Added "AI-Powered Development" section
- Documented agent capabilities and usage
- Included component reuse pattern examples
- Listed agent's areas of expertise

### 3. Memory Bank Updates
**LLM Agent Integration Document:**
- Marked Phase 1 (Agent Prompt Creation) as completed ✅
- Updated status with completed deliverables
- Documented agent location and capabilities

## Agent Capabilities

The circuit-synth agent specializes in:

### Code Review & Best Practices
- Analyzing circuit-synth projects for proper structure
- Identifying component reuse opportunities
- Suggesting better net management approaches
- Ensuring consistent naming conventions

### Syntax Guidance
- Component definition patterns
- @circuit decorator proper usage
- Pin connection syntax (mixed integer/string access)
- Net creation and naming best practices

### Structure & Organization
- Single-file circuit organization principles
- Hierarchical circuit design patterns
- Clear separation of concerns between subcircuits
- Meaningful variable naming conventions

## Technical Implementation

### Component Reuse Pattern
```python
# Template definition at top of file
C_10uF_0805 = Component(
    symbol="Device:C", ref="C", value="10uF",
    footprint="Capacitor_SMD:C_0805_2012Metric"
)

# Instance creation with unique reference
cap_input = C_10uF_0805()
cap_input.ref = "C4"  # Override for specific usage
```

### Circuit Structure Pattern
```python
@circuit
def regulator(_5V, _3v3, GND):
    """Clear docstring describing functionality"""
    # Implementation with meaningful variable names
    # Component instantiation and connections
```

## Integration with Circuit-Synth Workflow

The agent integrates with the established development workflow:
1. **Code Review**: Analyzes circuit-synth files for best practices
2. **Refactoring**: Suggests improvements for maintainability
3. **Learning**: Helps users understand proper circuit-synth patterns
4. **Consistency**: Ensures adherence to project conventions

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Search Tool Development (Remaining)
- Investigate existing search capabilities in codebase
- Implement/enhance symbol search functionality
- Implement/enhance footprint search functionality
- Create LLM-friendly search API

### Phase 3: Component Database (Remaining)
- Build comprehensive symbol reference database
- Build comprehensive footprint reference database
- Include component descriptions and use cases
- Add pin mapping information for complex parts

## Impact

### For Users
- **Expert Guidance**: AI-powered code review and best practices
