# Testing Infrastructure Fixes

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in automated testing infrastructure: Rust test parsing now shows accurate test counts, resolved defensive logging shutdown errors, and corrected test result reporting.

## Key Changes
- Fixed Rust test result parsing to show proper counts (e.g., "32 tests passed" vs "0 tests passed")
- Eliminated ValueError logging errors during test shutdown by disabling atexit handler during pytest
- Implemented proper test result tracking using global variables for accurate summary reporting

## Impact
All testing scripts now work correctly with proper error handling and accurate reporting. Python tests show 165 passed, Rust modules show actual test counts, and the comprehensive test suite provides reliable feedback for development workflows.
