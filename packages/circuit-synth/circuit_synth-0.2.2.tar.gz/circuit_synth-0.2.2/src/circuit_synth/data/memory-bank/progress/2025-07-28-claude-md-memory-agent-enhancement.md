- **Agent workflow**: Documented all 5 agents (`orchestrator`, `architect`, `code`, `circuit-synth`, `general-purpose`) with specific use cases and examples
- **Workflow patterns**: Created example flows for circuit design, code enhancement, and research tasks

## Impact
Enables effective context preservation across sessions and optimal specialist agent selection for different request types.
