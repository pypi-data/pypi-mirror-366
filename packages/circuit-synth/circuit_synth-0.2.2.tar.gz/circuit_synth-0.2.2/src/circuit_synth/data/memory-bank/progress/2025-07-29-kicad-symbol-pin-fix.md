# KiCad Symbol Pin Positioning Fix

## Summary
Fixed KiCad symbol pin positioning issue where pins appeared at (0,0) coordinates with zero length. Temporarily disabled Rust symbol cache to use Python cache which provides correct pin coordinates.

## Impact
KiCad project generation now produces properly rendered symbols with pins at correct positions and appropriate lengths.
