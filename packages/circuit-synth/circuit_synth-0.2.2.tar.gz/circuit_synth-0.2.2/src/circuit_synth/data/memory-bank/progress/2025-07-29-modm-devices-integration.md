# MODM-Devices Integration for Component Search

## Summary
Successfully integrated the modm-devices submodule to enable intelligent microcontroller search with comprehensive specifications and peripheral matching.

## Key Implementation
- **Created ModmDeviceSearch class**: Leverages modm-devices XML database for MCU search
- **Specification-based filtering**: Search by family, series, memory, package, peripherals
- **KiCad integration**: Automatic symbol/footprint mapping for found components
- **Circuit-synth ready**: Generates complete component definitions
- **Manufacturing awareness**: Availability scoring for production readiness

## Features Added
- **Family support**: STM32, AVR, SAM, NRF, RP2040 microcontroller families
- **Advanced filtering**: Flash/RAM size, pin count, temperature grade, package type
- **Peripheral matching**: Find MCUs with required interfaces (USART, SPI, I2C, etc.)
- **Easy-use functions**: `search_stm32()`, `search_by_peripherals()`
- **Claude command**: `/find-mcu` for AI-powered MCU recommendation

## Technical Details
- **Database**: Utilizes comprehensive modm-devices XML specifications
- **Search algorithm**: Multi-criteria filtering with availability scoring
- **Output format**: Structured MCUSearchResult with all relevant information
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when modm-devices unavailable

## Usage Examples
```python
# Quick STM32 search
results = search_stm32(series="g4", flash_min=128, package="lqfp")

# Peripheral-based search  
results = search_by_peripherals(["USART", "SPI"], family="stm32")

# Advanced specification search
spec = MCUSpecification(family="stm32", flash_min=256, peripherals=["CAN"])
results = searcher.search_mcus(spec)
```

## Impact
Users can now intelligently search and select microcontrollers based on technical requirements rather than browsing catalogs manually. Integration with Claude Code provides AI-powered MCU recommendations with ready-to-use circuit-synth code.
