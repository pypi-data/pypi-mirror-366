## Detailed Feature Analysis

### 1. Syntax and Development Experience

**TSCircuit Approach:**
```tsx
const Circuit = () => (
  <board width="50mm" height="50mm">
    <resistor
      name="R1"
      resistance="10ohm"
      footprint="0805"
      pcb_x="4mm"
      pcb_y="-1mm"
    />
    <capacitor
      name="C1"
      capacitance="100nF"
      footprint="0603"
      pcb_x="8mm"
      pcb_y="2mm"
    />
    <trace path={[".R1 > .right", ".C1 > .left"]} />
  </board>
)
```

**Circuit-synth Approach:**
```python
@circuit(name="simple_circuit")
def simple_circuit():
    # Create nets
    vcc = Net('VCC')
    gnd = Net('GND')
    
    # Create components
    r1 = Component("Device:R", ref="R", value="10", footprint="R_0805")
    c1 = Component("Device:C", ref="C", value="100nF", footprint="C_0603")
    
    # Connect components
    r1[1] += vcc
    r1[2] += c1[1]
    c1[2] += gnd
```

**Analysis:** TSCircuit feels like web development with JSX components, while circuit-synth uses traditional Python function syntax. TSCircuit may be more approachable for web developers, while circuit-synth is more familiar to engineers.

### 2. Development Environment

**TSCircuit:**
- **Browser-based IDE** with real-time preview
- **Online playground** for immediate experimentation
- **Hot reload** development experience
- **3D visualization** built into the development flow
- **Component registry** with web interface

**Circuit-synth:**
- **Local development** with Python IDEs
- **KiCad integration** for professional workflows
- **Command-line tools** for automation
- **Bidirectional editing** between code and KiCad

**Key Difference:** TSCircuit prioritizes web-like development experience, while circuit-synth integrates with traditional EE tools.

### 3. Component System

**TSCircuit:**
```tsx
// Abstract, high-level components
<resistor resistance="10kohm" footprint="0805" />
<chip name="atmega328p" />
<trace path={[".U1 > .D0", ".R1 > .left"]} />

// Built-in component library
<MySubcomponent name="U1" footprint="sot236" />
```

**Circuit-synth:**
```python
# Explicit KiCad symbol/footprint references
r1 = Component(
    symbol="Device:R", 
    ref="R", 
    value="10K",
    footprint="Resistor_SMD:R_0805_2012Metric"
)

# Pin-level connections
r1[1] += net_a
r1[2] += net_b
```

**Analysis:** TSCircuit abstracts away KiCad specifics for simpler syntax, while circuit-synth requires KiCad knowledge but provides more control.

### 4. Layout and Routing

**TSCircuit:**
- **Automatic layout algorithms** inspired by CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Built-in autorouting** with web-based visualization
- **Real-time 3D preview** during development
- **Position-based placement** with `pcb_x`/`pcb_y`

**Circuit-synth:**
- **KiCad-based placement** (in development)
- **Professional PCB tools** integration
- **Manual placement** with KiCad workflows
- **Bidirectional updates** between code and layout

### 5. Manufacturing and Export

**TSCircuit:**
```tsx
// Export for manufacturing
export default () => (
  <board width="50mm" height="50mm">
    {/* circuit definition */}
  </board>
)
// Automatically generates Gerbers, BOM, Pick & Place
```

**Circuit-synth:**
```python
# Generate KiCad project
circuit = my_circuit()
circuit.generate_kicad_project("project_name")
# Use KiCad for manufacturing files
```

**Analysis:** Both support manufacturing export, but TSCircuit has integrated flow while circuit-synth relies on KiCad's export capabilities.
