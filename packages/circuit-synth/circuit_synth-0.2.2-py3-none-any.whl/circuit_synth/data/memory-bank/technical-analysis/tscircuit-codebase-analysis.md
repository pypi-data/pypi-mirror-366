```

## Core Circuit Building System

### Circuit JSON Format
**Central Data Structure:** `circuit-json`

TSCircuit uses a standardized JSON format as the universal circuit representation:

```typescript
// Circuit JSON structure
interface CircuitJson {
  components: ComponentElement[]
  nets: NetElement[]
  pcb_traces: PCBTraceElement[] 
  schematic: SchematicElement[]
  // ... other elements
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Universal Format:** Single representation for all circuit aspects
- **Serializable:** Can be stored, transmitted, and versioned
- **Tool Agnostic:** Not tied to specific EDA tools
- **Extensible:** Easy to add new element types

### Component System Architecture
**Core Package:** `@tscircuit/core`

The core system converts React elements to Circuit JSON:

```typescript
// React-style component definition
const circuit = new Circuit()
circuit.add(
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
    <resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" />
    <led name="L1" footprint="0402" />
    <trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to="net.VCC" />
  </board>
)
```

**Architecture Components:**
- **React Fiber Integration:** Uses React's reconciliation for circuit trees
- **Element Processors:** Convert JSX elements to Circuit JSON
- **Constraint Solver:** Resolves component positions and connections
- **Validation System:** Ensures circuit integrity

### Component Property System
**Package:** `@tscircuit/props`

Comprehensive property definitions for all components:

```typescript
// Component properties with TypeScript definitions
interface ResistorProps {
  name: string
  resistance: string | number
  footprint: string
  power_rating?: string
  tolerance?: string
  pcb_x?: number | string
  pcb_y?: number | string
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript definitions for all properties
- **Validation:** Runtime property validation
- **Auto-completion:** IDE support for component properties
- **Documentation:** Inline documentation for all properties

## Code Evaluation System

### Dynamic Code Execution
**Package:** `@tscircuit/eval`

TSCircuit provides sophisticated code evaluation capabilities:

```typescript
// Multiple execution methods
runTscircuitCode(code: string): Promise<CircuitJson>
CircuitWebWorker.eval(code: string): Promise<CircuitJson>
CircuitRunner.execute(code: string): CircuitJson
```

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-environment Support:** Browser, Node.js, Web Workers
- **Automatic Import Resolution:** CDN-based module loading
- **Babel Transpilation:** Modern JavaScript feature support
- **Virtual Filesystem:** Multi-file circuit support

**Execution Process:**
1. **Code Scanning:** Identify imports and dependencies
2. **CDN Fetching:** Load modules from tscircuit registry
3. **Transpilation:** Babel transforms for compatibility
4. **Execution:** Run in isolated environment with global `circuit`
5. **JSON Generation:** Convert result to Circuit JSON

### Web Worker Integration
TSCircuit provides non-blocking execution:

```typescript
// Prevent UI blocking during circuit evaluation
const worker = new CircuitWebWorker()
const result = await worker.eval(circuitCode)
```

**Benefits:**
- **UI Responsiveness:** Prevents main thread blocking
- **Isolation:** Sandboxed execution environment
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple circuits simultaneously
- **Error Containment:** Worker crashes don't affect main app

## Layout and Routing System

### Autolayout Algorithms
**Package:** `@tscircuit/autolayout`

CSS-inspired layout system for circuit components:

```typescript
// CSS-like layout properties
<group layout="flex" direction="row">
  <resistor name="R1" />
  <resistor name="R2" />
</group>
```

**Layout Features:**
- **Flexbox-style Layout:** Familiar web development paradigms
- **Grid System:** CSS Grid equivalent for circuits
- **Constraint-based:** Advanced positioning constraints

### Trace Routing System  
**Package:** `@tscircuit/routing`

Advanced autorouting algorithms:

```typescript
// Automatic trace routing
<trace from=".U1 > .pin1" to=".R1 > .left" />
<trace from=".R1 > .right" to="net.VCC" />
```

**Routing Features:**
- **A* Pathfinding:** Optimal path finding for traces
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Routes around components and existing traces
- **Layer Management:** Multi-layer PCB routing
- **Via Optimization:** Minimize layer changes

## Footprint Generation System

### Footprinter DSL
**Package:** `@tscircuit/footprinter`

Domain-specific language for footprint creation:

```typescript
// Programmatic footprint generation
const qfp64 = new Footprint()
  .qfp({
    pins: 64,
    pitch: 0.5,
    body_width: 10,
    body_height: 10
  })
```
