# STM32G0 Development Kit Implementation

## Summary
Created complete STM32G0 development kit with pin name validation and JLCPCB component verification. Fixed circuit-synth pin mapping issues by investigating actual KiCad symbol pin names.

## Key Changes
- Implemented STM32G050C8T6 devkit with USB-C power, SWD programming, and GPIO expansion
- Resolved pin naming conflicts by using correct KiCad symbol references (VDD/VSS vs VDDA/VSSA)
- Verified component availability through JLCPCB integration

## Impact
Users can now generate working STM32G0 development boards with verified component availability and correct pin assignments.
