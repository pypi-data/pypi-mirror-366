# STM32 Peripheral Search Workflow Complete

## Summary
Fixed modm-devices integration and implemented direct STM32 peripheral search pattern, enabling instant component recommendations for queries like "find stm32 with 3 spis available on jlcpcb".

## Key Changes
- Fixed modm-devices API usage (Device object creation and identifier access)
- Added pattern detection for STM32 + peripheral queries with direct function routing
- Implemented UART/USART equivalence and smart peripheral counting

## Impact
Users get STM32 recommendations in 15 seconds vs 4+ minutes, with complete circuit-synth code and JLCPCB availability data.
