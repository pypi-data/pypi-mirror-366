# Repository Organization and Structure

## Summary
Reorganized circuit-synth repository structure to eliminate root-level clutter and create professional, logical directory organization with dedicated tools/ directory for CI setup scripts.

## Key Changes
- Moved CI setup scripts to `tools/ci-setup/` directory with comprehensive documentation
- Relocated Claude integration docs to `docs/integration/` 
- Created organized structure separating development tools from runtime scripts

## Impact
Clean, professional repository structure that's easier to navigate and maintain, with clear separation between user-facing components and development utilities.
