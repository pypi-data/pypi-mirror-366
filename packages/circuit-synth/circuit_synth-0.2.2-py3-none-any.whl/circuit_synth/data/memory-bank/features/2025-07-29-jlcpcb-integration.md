# JLCPCB Manufacturing Integration - 2025-07-29

## Overview
Integrated comprehensive JLCPCB component availability and pricing data into circuit-synth, enabling real-time manufacturability analysis during circuit design.

## Implementation Complete

### Core Integration Module
**Location:** `src/circuit_synth/jlc_integration/`

**Key Files:**
- `jlc_parts_lookup.py` - Direct API integration with JLCPCB
- `jlc_web_scraper.py` - Web scraping fallback without API keys  
- `__init__.py` - Unified interface for both approaches

### Dual Access Strategy

**1. API-Based Access (Premium)**
- Direct integration with JLCPCB external API
- Requires API key and secret credentials
- Real-time stock levels and pricing data
- Rate-limited but comprehensive access

**2. Web Scraping Access (Free)**
- Scrapes public JLCPCB component search pages
- No credentials required - works immediately
- Real-time data extraction from live website
- Respectful scraping with rate limiting

### Key Functions Available

```python
from circuit_synth.jlc_integration import (
    # Web scraping (no credentials needed)
    get_component_availability_web,
    search_jlc_components_web,
    enhance_component_with_web_data,
    
    # API access (requires JLCPCB_KEY/SECRET)
    recommend_jlc_component,
    enhance_component_with_jlc_data
)

# Example usage
stm32_availability = get_component_availability_web("STM32G4")
print(f"Most available: {stm32_availability['part_number']} - {stm32_availability['stock']} units")
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Comprehensive Unit Tests
**Location:** `tests/unit/jlc_integration/`

**Coverage:**
- **43 test cases** covering all functionality
- **API interface testing** with mocked responses
- **Web scraping validation** with mock HTML parsing
- **Error handling scenarios** for network failures
- **Integration workflows** for real-world usage

**Test Results:** All 43 tests passing ✅

### Test Categories
1. **JlcPartsInterface** - API authentication, component search, stock analysis
2. **JlcWebScraper** - HTML parsing, component extraction, availability ranking  
3. **Manufacturability Scoring** - Component assessment algorithms
4. **Integration Scenarios** - End-to-end workflow validation
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and recovery

### Production Workflow
```python
# Enhanced circuit design with manufacturing awareness
@circuit(name="production_ready_board")
def create_board():
    # Component selection with availability check
    mcu_availability = get_component_availability_web("STM32G431CBT6")
    
    if mcu_availability and mcu_availability['stock'] > 1000:
        mcu = Component(
            symbol="MCU_ST_STM32G4:STM32G431CBT6",
            ref="U1",
            footprint="Package_QFP:LQFP-48_7x7mm_P0.5mm"
        )
        print(f"✅ MCU in stock: {mcu_availability['stock']} units")
    else:
        print("⚠️ Consider alternative MCU - low stock")
```

## Proven Capabilities
