# SPICE Integration Roadmap for Circuit-synth

## Overview

SPICE integration is a critical feature gap compared to SKIDL. Adding PySpice integration would enable circuit simulation capabilities directly from circuit-synth designs, making it competitive with SKIDL's simulation features.

## Current Competitive Gap

**SKIDL's SPICE Integration:**
```python
from skidl.pyspice import *

vs = V(ref="VS", dc_value=1@u_V)
r = R(value=1000@u_Ohm)
vs["p"] & r & gnd & vs["n"]

circ = generate_netlist()
sim = circ.simulator()
dc_vals = sim.dc(VS=slice(0, 10, 0.1))
```

**Circuit-synth Gap:** No built-in SPICE simulation capabilities.

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority** - SPICE integration is essential for:
1. Competitive parity with SKIDL
2. Professional engineering workflows requiring simulation
3. AI-driven circuit optimization capabilities
4. Educational and research applications

## Proposed Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic PySpice Integration (Q1 2025)
- Convert circuit-synth components to SPICE netlists
- Basic DC/AC analysis capabilities
- Simple simulation API integration

### Phase 2: Advanced Simulation Features (Q2-Q3 2025)  
- Transient analysis and plotting
- Component parameter sweeps
- Monte Carlo analysis for tolerances
- Integration with AI placement algorithms

### Phase 3: Professional Features (Q4 2025)
- Multi-corner analysis
- Automated design optimization
- Performance metrics and reporting
- Comprehensive model libraries

## Success Criteria

- Match SKIDL's core simulation capabilities
- Maintain circuit-synth's simplicity and KiCad integration
- Enable AI-driven circuit design optimization
- Support professional engineering simulation workflows
