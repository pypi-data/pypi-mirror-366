# Intelligent Placement Roadmap

## Overview

Currently, circuit-synth places components functionally but not intelligently. This document outlines the roadmap for implementing intelligent component and schematic placement algorithms.

## Current State

### Component Placement
- **PCB**: Components are placed using basic algorithms (connection_aware, sequential, llm)
- **Schematic**: Parts are placed without considering signal flow or logical grouping
- **Status**: Functional but requires manual optimization for professional use

### Available Algorithms
- `connection_aware` (default)
- `sequential` 
- `llm` (deprecated - removed for performance)

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Enhanced PCB Placement
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: Next major release

#### Signal Integrity Aware Placement
- **High-speed signals**: Keep trace lengths short and matched
- **Power distribution**: Optimize decoupling capacitor placement
- **EMI considerations**: Separate analog/digital sections
- **Thermal management**: Distribute heat-generating components

#### Implementation Approach
- Extend existing `rust_force_directed_placement` module
- Add signal classification (power, high-speed, low-speed, analog)
- Implement constraint-based placement with configurable rules
- Integration with existing `connection_aware` algorithm

### Phase 2: Intelligent Schematic Placement
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: Following Phase 1

#### Logical Grouping
- **Functional blocks**: Group related components (power, communication, etc.)
- **Signal flow**: Arrange components to follow signal path
- **Hierarchy awareness**: Respect circuit hierarchy and subcircuits
- **Readability**: Optimize for human understanding

#### Implementation Approach
- Analyze circuit connectivity and component types
- Use graph algorithms to identify functional clusters
- Implement auto-routing for clean schematic connections
- Configurable placement templates for common patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Priority**: Medium
**Timeline**: Future releases

#### AI-Powered Optimization
- **Machine learning**: Learn from professional PCB layouts
- **Design rule integration**: Automatic DRC-aware placement
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balance size, performance, cost
- **Interactive feedback**: Allow user guidance and constraints

#### Cross-Domain Optimization
- **Simultaneous schematic/PCB**: Optimize both representations together
- **Manufacturing awareness**: Consider assembly and test constraints
- **Supply chain**: Optimize for component availability and cost

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes Required

1. **Enhanced Component Metadata**
   ```python
   class Component:
       # Add placement hints and constraints
       placement_category: str  # "power", "analog", "digital", "high_speed"
       thermal_profile: ThermalConstraints
       signal_integrity_rules: List[SIRule]
   ```

2. **Placement Engine Refactor**
   - Abstract placement interface for different algorithms
   - Pluggable constraint system
   - Performance metrics and optimization feedback

3. **Integration Points**
   - Update `generate_kicad_project()` to use new algorithms
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
   - Add configuration options for placement behavior

### Development Approach

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyze existing professional PCB layouts
   - Study industry best practices for placement
   - Benchmark current algorithm performance

2. **Prototype Development**
   - Implement core algorithms in Rust for performance
   - Create Python bindings for integration
   - Develop test cases with measurable improvement metrics

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - Update circuit-synth API to support new features
   - Comprehensive testing with real-world circuits
   - Performance optimization and benchmarking

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Trace length reduction**: Target 20-30% improvement for high-speed signals
- **Thermal distribution**: More even heat distribution across board
- **DRC violations**: Significant reduction in design rule violations
- **Generation time**: Maintain or improve current generation speeds

### Qualitative
- **Professional usability**: Layouts require minimal manual optimization
- **Readability**: Schematics are logically organized and easy to follow
- **User feedback**: Positive reception from professional developers

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Rust placement modules (`rust_force_directed_placement`, `rust_symbol_cache`)
- KiCad integration layer
- Component library and metadata systems

### External
- KiCad symbol and footprint libraries
- Industry design rule databases
- PCB manufacturing constraint data

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Performance impact**: New algorithms may be slower
  - *Mitigation*: Implement in Rust, use caching, parallel processing
- **Complexity**: More sophisticated algorithms may be harder to debug
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, visualization tools, fallback options

### User Experience Risks
- **Breaking changes**: New defaults may change existing layouts
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain backward compatibility, gradual rollout
- **Configuration complexity**: Too many options may overwhelm users
  - *Mitigation*: Smart defaults, progressive disclosure, templates
