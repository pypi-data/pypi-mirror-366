# sklearn_migrator

**sklearn_migrator** is a lightweight Python library that helps you serialize and migrate scikit-learn models across different versions.  
It is especially useful when models are trained using older versions of scikit-learn and need to be loaded or interpreted in newer environments.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Serialize `DecisionTreeRegressor` models safely
- 🔄 Add compatibility adjustments for internal node structures
- 🧪 Facilitate model version migration without retraining
- 📦 Easy to install and use

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tu_usuario/sklearn_migrator.git
```

Thanks for all the contributions!
