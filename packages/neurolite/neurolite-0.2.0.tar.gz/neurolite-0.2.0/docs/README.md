# NeuroLite Documentation

Welcome to NeuroLite - the AI/ML/DL/NLP productivity library that enables you to build, train, and deploy machine learning models with minimal code (under 10 lines).

## Quick Start

```python
import neurolite

# Train a model with just one line
model = neurolite.train('data/my_dataset.csv', task='classification')

# Deploy it with another line
neurolite.deploy(model, format='api', port=8080)
```
