# Spotify-Jam

A package to manage Spotify Jams!

## Installation

```
pip install spotify-jam
```

## Quick Start

Make sure to get your auth token. It seems to expire every so often but i got my mine by going to the Spotify web player and opening inspect element, going to the networking, making a request like playing a song, and then grabbing the "Authorization" value from a header.  

```python
import spotify_jam
import time
auth = "BEARER PERSONAL_TOKEN_HERE"

inviteURI, sessionId = spotify_jam.startJam(auth)
spotify_jam.allowJamUsersControlQueue(False)
toKickId = ""
for member in spotify_jam.getJamData(auth, sessionId)["session_members"]:
    toKickId = member["id"]
spotify_jam.kickJamUser(auth, sessionId, toKickId)
time.sleep(2)
spotify_jam.endJam(auth, sessionId)
```
