# mp3tools
Merge mp3 files and set correct audio length using foobar2000 with an automated python script. These scripts can merge all files in one directory or create one file for each subdirectory.


![merge mp3 files from subdirectories](https://github.com/carsten-engelke/mp3tools/blob/main/mergemp3subdirs.jpg)
 - mp3tools merge-mp3: merging script, works with foobar2000
 - mp3tools pack-subdirs: pack files into grouped subdirectories (good for large audiobooks)
 - mp3tools unpack-subdirs.py: unpack files from grouped subdirectories (undo mp3tools pack-subdirs)
