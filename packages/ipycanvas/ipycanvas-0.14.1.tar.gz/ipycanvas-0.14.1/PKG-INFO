ipycanvas is a lightweight, fast and stable library exposing the [browser's Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to IPython.
It allows you to draw simple primitives directly from Python like text, lines, polygons, arcs, images etc. This simple toolset allows you to draw literally anything!
