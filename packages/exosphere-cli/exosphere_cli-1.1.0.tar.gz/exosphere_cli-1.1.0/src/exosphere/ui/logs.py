    Custom logging handler to display logs in the UI

    Involves a running buffer to store logs until the log widget is set,

    at that point, and any new logs will be written directly to the
    widget, in the log screen.

    The buffering should be reasonably thread-safe, but it is a very
    clumsy and naive attempt at reentrant locking, since the
    application is made of a mix of threads and async coroutines.
