    """Class to export 1D profiles of a field in a simulation.

    Args:
        field: the species for which the profile is computed.
        subdomain: the volume subdomain to compute the profile on. If None, the profile
            is computed over the entire domain.
        times: if provided, the profile will be exported at these timesteps.
            Otherwise, exports at all timesteps. Defaults to None.

    Attributes:
        field: the species for which the profile is computed.
        subdomain: the volume subdomain to compute the profile on. If None, the profile
            is computed over the entire domain.
        times: if provided, the profile will be exported at these timesteps. Otherwise,
            exports at all timesteps.
        x: the coordinates along which the profile is computed.
        data: the computed profile data.
        t: the list of time values at which the profile is computed.
