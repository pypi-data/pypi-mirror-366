Plugin Loading System

This module handles the automatic discovery and loading of all CaelumSys plugins.
When load_plugins() is called, it scans the plugins directory and imports all
Python modules, which triggers their @register_command decorators to register
their commands with the system.

The plugin system is designed to be:
- Automatic: No manual registration needed
- Extensible: Just add a .py file to the plugins folder
- Isolated: Each plugin is a separate module
- Discoverable: All plugins are loaded at startup

Plugin Structure:
    Each plugin should be a Python file in this directory that uses the
    @register_command decorator to register its commands.

    Example plugin (example_plugin.py):
        from caelum_sys.registry import register_command

        @register_command("my command")
        def my_function():
            return "Command executed!"

import importlib  # For dynamic module importing
import pkgutil  # For discovering modules in a package


def load_plugins():
    """
    Dynamically discover and import all plugin modules in the plugins package.

    This function scans the current package directory for all Python modules
    (excluding __init__.py and __pycache__) and imports them. When a plugin
    module is imported, any @register_command decorators in that module are
    executed, automatically registering the commands with the system.

    The loading process:
    1. Scan the plugins directory for .py files
    2. Import each module dynamically
    3. The import triggers @register_command decorators
    4. Commands become available in the global registry

    This function is automatically called when the main caelum_sys package
    is imported, so users don't need to call it manually.

    Example:
        # This happens automatically when you do:
        from caelum_sys import do

        # But you can also call it manually if needed:
        from caelum_sys.plugins import load_plugins
        load_plugins()

    Raises:
        ImportError: If a plugin module has syntax errors or missing dependencies

    Note:
        Failed plugin imports are currently not handled gracefully. Consider
        adding error handling for production use.
