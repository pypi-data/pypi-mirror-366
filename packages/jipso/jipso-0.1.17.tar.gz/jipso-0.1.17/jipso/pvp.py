  """Compares effectiveness of instruction prompts.
  
  The Prompt vs Prompt function provides systematic prompt engineering through
  controlled evaluation methodology. Generates objective test inputs, executes
  both prompts under identical conditions, and evaluates relative performance
  against specified criteria.
  
  Transforms prompt optimization from trial-and-error approach into scientific
  methodology with quantitative assessment. Supports iterative improvement
  cycles, deployment readiness validation, and prompt saturation detection
  for production-quality AI instruction development.
