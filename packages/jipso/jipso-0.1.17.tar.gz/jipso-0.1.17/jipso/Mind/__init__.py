Mind Module - AI Client Abstractions
====================================

The `Mind` module contains all client interfaces for communicating with different AI service providers.

This layer acts as the "thinking engine" of the JIPSO framework, abstracting calls to external AI systems.
Each client implements a standardized API for invoking models, retrieving responses, and managing model configurations.

Supported AI Platforms:
-----------------------
- OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- Anthropic (e.g., Claude 3)
- Google (e.g., Gemini)
- Hugging Face (cloud and local)
- Ollama (local LLM inference)
- Alibaba Cloud
- Tencent
- Sberbank
- X.AI (Elon Musk's Grok, if available)

Design Principles:
------------------
- Each client lives in a separate file: `ClientOpenai.py`, `ClientAnthropic.py`, etc.
- All clients follow a unified method signature and interface contract
- Allows plug-and-play orchestration: easily swap AI backends in benchmarking or production
