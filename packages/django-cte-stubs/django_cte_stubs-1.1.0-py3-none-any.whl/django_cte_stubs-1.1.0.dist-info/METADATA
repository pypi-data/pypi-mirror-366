# django-cte-stubs

Type stubs for the `django-cte` package,
enabling static type checking and improved IDE experiences for Django developers.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive type stubs for the `django-cte` package.
- Better type hinting and autocompletions in supported IDEs.
- Compatible with Python 3.9 and above.
- Compatible with django-stubs 5.*
- Compatible with mypy==1.*

## Installation

To get started with `django-cte-stubs`, simply install the package via pip:

pip install django-cte-stubs
```


## Typing Examples

We have provided a few examples of how typing is implemented using these stubs. Explore the following modules in our test suite for more insights:

- [simple.py](./tests/project/examples/simple.py) simple CTE typing
- [raw.py](./tests/project/examples/raw.py) With raw sql code
- [recursive_example.py](./tests/project/tests/recursive_example.py) With a recursive CTE.
