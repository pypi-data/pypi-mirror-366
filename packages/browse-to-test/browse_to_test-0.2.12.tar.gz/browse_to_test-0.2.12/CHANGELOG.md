All notable changes to the Browse-to-Test project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Language-Aware Comment Management System** - Centralized comment formatting for all supported programming languages
- **Enhanced Multi-Language Support** - Proper syntax generation for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and Java
- **Contextual Information Comments** - Rich metadata-driven comments based on input data and automation context
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Added 17 test cases for comment management system with 93% code coverage

### Changed
- **Comment Generation**: Replaced hardcoded Python-style comments (`#`) with language-appropriate formats
  - Python: `# comment` and `"""docstrings"""`
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: `// comment` and `/** JSDoc */`

  - Java: `// comment` and `/** Javadoc */`
- **Language Generators**: Updated all language generators to use the new `CommentManager` for consistent formatting
- **Session Orchestration**: Enhanced session management with language-aware step commenting

### Fixed
- **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Eliminated syntax errors in non-Python generated code due to incorrect comment formats
- **Documentation Consistency**: Standardized documentation string formats across all supported languages

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v2.1.0 (Async Support)

#### From Sync to Async

**Before:**
```python
import browse_to_test as btt

script = btt.convert(automation_data, framework="playwright")
session = btt.IncrementalSession(config)
result = session.add_step(step_data)
```

**After:**
```python
import asyncio
import browse_to_test as btt

async def main():
    script = await btt.convert_async(automation_data, framework="playwright")
    session = btt.AsyncIncrementalSession(config)
    result = await session.add_step_async(step_data)

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Performance Benefits

- **Single conversion**: Similar performance to sync
- **Multiple conversions**: 3-5x faster with `asyncio.gather()`
- **Large datasets**: Significant memory and time savings
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking step addition

### Upgrading to v2.0.0 (Context-Aware)

#### Configuration Changes

**Before:**
```python
config = {
    "ai_provider": "openai",
    "framework": "playwright"
}
```

**After:**
```python
config = btt.ConfigBuilder() \
    .ai_provider("openai") \
    .framework("playwright") \
    .enable_context_collection() \
    .build()
```

#### Enhanced Features

- Context collection requires explicit enablement
- New processing configuration options
- Improved AI provider configuration

## Performance Benchmarks

### Async vs Sync Performance

| Operation | Sync Time | Async Time | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Single conversion | 2.3s | 2.4s | -4% |
| 5 parallel conversions | 11.5s | 3.2s | 259% |
| 10 parallel conversions | 23.0s | 4.8s | 379% |
| Large dataset (50 steps) | 45.2s | 9.1s | 397% |

### Memory Usage

| Scenario | Sync Memory | Async Memory | Improvement |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Single session | 85 MB | 82 MB | 4% |
| 5 concurrent sessions | 425 MB | 150 MB | 183% |
| 10 concurrent sessions | 850 MB | 220 MB | 286% |

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **C# and Java Support**: Language generators are implemented but framework integration is in progress
2. **Async Error Handling**: Some edge cases in async queue management are being addressed
3. **Context Analysis**: Deep context analysis can be memory-intensive for very large projects

### Workarounds

1. **Language Support**: Use Python/JavaScript/TypeScript for full functionality
2. **Async Errors**: Use try-catch blocks and timeout configuration
3. **Memory Usage**: Configure `max_context_files` and `context_analysis_depth` for large projects
