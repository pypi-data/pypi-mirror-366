        This function takes as a starting point the unique statements (with
        duplicates removed) and returns a modified flat list of statements
        containing only those statements which do not represent a refinement of
        other existing statements. In other words, the more general versions of
        a given statement do not appear at the top level, but instead are
        listed in the `supports` field of the top-level statements.

        If :py:attr:`unique_stmts` has not been initialized with the
        de-duplicated statements, :py:meth:`combine_duplicates` is called
        internally.

        After this function is called the attribute :py:attr:`related_stmts` is
        set as a side-effect.

        The procedure for combining statements in this way involves a series
        of steps:

        1. The statements are subjected to (built-in or user-supplied) filters
           that group them based on potential refinement relationships. For
           instance, the ontology-based filter positions each statement,
           based on its agent arguments, with the ontology, and determines
           potential refinements based on paths in the ontology graph.
        2. Each statement is then compared with the set of statements it
           can potentially refine, as determined by the pre-filters.
           If the statement represents a refinement of
           the other (as defined by the `refinement_of()` method implemented
           for the Statement), then the more refined statement is added
           to the `supports` field of the more general statement, and the
           more general statement is added to the `supported_by` field of
           the more refined statement.
        3. A new flat list of statements is created that contains only those
           statements that have no `supports` entries (statements containing
           such entries are not eliminated, because they will be retrievable
           from the `supported_by` fields of other statements). This list
           is returned to the caller.

        .. note:: Subfamily relationships must be consistent across arguments

            For now, we require that merges can only occur if the *isa*
            relationships are all in the *same direction for all the agents* in
            a Statement. For example, the two statement groups: `RAF_family ->
            MEK1` and `BRAF -> MEK_family` would not be merged, since BRAF
            *isa* RAF_family, but MEK_family is not a MEK1. In the future this
            restriction could be revisited.

        Parameters
        ----------
        return_toplevel : Optional[bool]
            If True only the top level statements are returned.
            If False, all statements are returned. Default: True
        filters : Optional[list[:py:class:`indra.preassembler.refinement.RefinementFilter`]]
            A list of RefinementFilter classes that implement filters on
            possible statement refinements. For details on how to
            construct such a filter, see the documentation of
            :py:class:`indra.preassembler.refinement.RefinementFilter`.
            If no user-supplied filters are provided, the default ontology-based
            filter is applied. If a list of filters is provided here, the
            :py:class:`indra.preassembler.refinement.OntologyRefinementFilter`
            isn't appended by default, and should be added by the user, if
            necessary. Default: None

        Returns
        -------
        list of :py:class:`indra.statement.Statement`
            The returned list contains Statements representing the more
            concrete/refined versions of the Statements involving particular
            entities. The attribute :py:attr:`related_stmts` is also set to
            this list. However, if return_toplevel is False then all
            statements are returned, irrespective of level of specificity.
            In this case the relationships between statements can
            be accessed via the supports/supported_by attributes.

        --------
