  # Task
  Reflect on what went well and what did not go well in the execution path based on the user's question.
  The summarized experiences should be generalizable, providing assistance in solving similar types of problems in the future. 
  They can include good suggestions or highlight areas to avoid and potential pitfalls.
  The type of experience can be plain text or a piece of code that solves a specific problem.
  If there are no experiences to summarize, output an empty list []. 
  For each experience, first state the scenario when it is applicable (when to use), then provide the experience itself, with a maximum of two experiences summarized.
