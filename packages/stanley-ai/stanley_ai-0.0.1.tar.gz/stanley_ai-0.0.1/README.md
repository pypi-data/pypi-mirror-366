# Stanley

Stanley is a simple collection of AI agents that are in use on a daily basis. These consist of financial assistants, news reporters, paper readers - and more! The library is meant to cover comprehensive use cases - from Claude Code SDK to multiple LLM providers. Stanley also comes with a front end - also built from scratch. 

The backend consists of Python, for the wider support of libraries.
