# Munidata

munidata is an API for accessing multiple instances of Unicode data.

The current version of munidata is a simple abstraction layer on top of the [picu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/picu) module.

## Pre-requisites

* Python (2.7, or >= 3.4)
* [picu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/picu) [MIT/X License]

## Setup

If your distribution does not package the required dependencies, the easiest way
to get a working environment in no-time is to use Python's virtual environments.

* Install [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)
* Create a python virtualenv:

		$ virtualenv venv

* Activate the environment:

		$ source ./venv/bin/activate

* Download dependencies:

		$ (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

* Install some versions of the [ICU library](http://site.icu-project.org/download)

## Use

To get the general category of a codepoint for multiple ICU versions:

    $ python test_munidata.py --libs /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/52.1/lib/libicuuc.dylib#/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/52.1/lib/libicui18n.52.1.dylib#52 --libs /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/4.4.1/lib/libicuuc.dylib#/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/4.4.1/lib/libicui18n.dylib#44 19DA gc
    Unicode version: %s 6.3.0.0
    U+19DA (NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE)
    Other_Number
    Unicode version: %s 5.2.0.0
    U+19DA (NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE)
    Decimal_Number

Same thing with just plain picu:

    $ python picu_multi.py --libs /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/52.1/lib/libicuuc.dylib#/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/52.1/lib/libicui18n.52.1.dylib#52 --libs /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/4.4.1/lib/libicuuc.dylib#/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/4.4.1/lib/libicui18n.dylib#44 19DA gc
