# Monstar CLI 🖥️

**GNOME Display Layout Manager CLI** - Save, manage, and quickly switch between multiple monitor configurations with integrated Tiling Shell support.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Save/Load Display Layouts** - Capture your current monitor setup and switch between them instantly
- 🎨 **Tiling Shell Integration** - Saves and restores Tiling Shell window layouts with each display profile
- ⚡ **Numbered Shortcuts** - Quick access with `monstar 1`, `monstar 2`, etc.
- 🔧 **Monitor Name Fix** - Automatically refreshes monitor names after configuration changes
- 💻 **Pure CLI** - Lightweight command-line only tool

## Installation

```bash
pip install monstar-cli
```

Or install with pipx for isolated environment:
```bash
pipx install monstar-cli
```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# List saved layouts
monstar list

# Save current display configuration (including Tiling Shell layouts)
monstar save work

# Load a saved layout
monstar load work

# Remove a layout
monstar remove old-layout

# Set up numbered shortcuts
monstar shortcut work 1
monstar shortcut play 2

# Quick switch using shortcuts
monstar 1  # Loads 'work' layout
monstar 2  # Loads 'play' layout

# List all shortcuts
monstar shortcuts

# Show help
monstar --help
```

## Requirements

- **Linux** with GNOME desktop environment
- **Python 3.6+**
- **PyGObject** (for DBus access)

On Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-gobject
```

## Configuration

Layouts are stored in `~/.config/monstar/` as JSON files.

### Layout Files Include:
- Display configuration (monitor positions, scales, resolutions, rotations)
- Tiling Shell window layouts (if Tiling Shell extension is installed)
- Custom shortcuts mapping

### Tiling Shell Integration
If you have Tiling Shell extension installed, Monstar will:
- Save your Tiling Shell layouts with each display profile
- Restore the correct window tiling when switching displays
- Automatically reload Tiling Shell to fix monitor names

## Uninstall

```bash
pip3 uninstall monstar-cli
rm -rf ~/.config/monstar/
```

## How It Works

Monstar uses GNOME's `org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig` DBus interface to:
1. **Capture** current monitor positions, scales, rotations, and modes
2. **Store** configurations as JSON files with human-readable names  
3. **Apply** saved layouts by reconstructing the exact display setup
4. **Backup** Tiling Shell window layouts from dconf settings
5. **Restore** complete workspace configurations including window tiling

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Monitor Names Reset
When switching display configurations, GNOME sometimes resets monitor names to generic "Monitor 1", "Monitor 2", etc. Monstar automatically reloads the Tiling Shell extension after each layout change to restore proper monitor names.


## Quick Start Guide

1. **Set up your displays** the way you like for work
2. **Save the layout**: `monstar save work`
3. **Create a shortcut**: `monstar shortcut work 1`
4. **Switch displays** for gaming/relaxing
5. **Save another layout**: `monstar save play`
6. **Create another shortcut**: `monstar shortcut play 2`
7. **Quick switch** anytime: `monstar 1` for work, `monstar 2` for play

## Why "Monstar"?

Because it manages your **mon**itor setup like a **star** ⭐ - and it sounds way cooler than "display-manager-thing".
