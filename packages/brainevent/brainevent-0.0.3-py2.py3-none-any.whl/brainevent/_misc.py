    """
    Checks the shapes and dtypes of inputs for sparse operations.

    Validates the dimensions and consistency of weights, indices, and a vector
    involved in a sparse matrix operation (like SpMV or SpM^T V). It adjusts
    the weights array based on its dimensions and the `require_scalar_weight`
    flag. It also determines the expected output shape based on the transpose
    flag.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : jax.Array
        The weights associated with the sparse connections. Can be 2D (same shape
        as indices), 1D (scalar weight), or 0D (scalar weight).
    indices : jax.Array
        The indices of the connections, typically of shape (n_pre, n_conn),
        where n_conn is the number of connections per pre-synaptic neuron.
    vector : jax.Array
        The vector to be multiplied with the sparse matrix. Its shape depends
        on the `transpose` flag.
    shape : Sequence[int]
        A sequence of two integers `(n_pre, n_post)` representing the logical
        shape of the dense equivalent matrix.
    transpose : bool
        If True, checks shapes for the transposed operation (vector * Matrix).
        If False, checks shapes for the forward operation (Matrix * vector).
    require_scalar_weight : bool, optional
        If True and weights are 1D or 0D, ensures weights is treated as a
        scalar value. If False and weights are 0D, converts weights to a 1D
        array of size 1. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    out_struct : jax.ShapeDtypeStruct
        A ShapeDtypeStruct representing the expected shape and dtype of the
        output vector.
    weights : jax.Array
        The potentially modified weights array (e.g., scalar extracted from
        1D array if `require_scalar_weight` is True, or 0D converted to 1D).
    n_pre : int
        The number of pre-synaptic elements.
    n_post : int
        The number of post-synaptic elements.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `weights` has dimensions other than 0, 1, or 2.
    AssertionError
        If shape inconsistencies are found between inputs (e.g., `weights`
        and `indices` shapes don't match when `weights` is 2D, `weights` is
        1D but not size 1, `indices` first dimension doesn't match `n_pre`,
        or `vector` shape doesn't match `n_pre` or `n_post` based on
        `transpose`).
