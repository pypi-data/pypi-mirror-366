*ssmdevices* is a collection of python wrappers that have been used for complex automated experiments at NIST. They are released here for transparency, for re-use of the drivers ``as-is'' by collaborators and the broader test community, and as a demonstration of lab automation based on [labbench](https://github.com/usnistgov/labbench).

The equipment includes consumer wireless communication hardware, test instruments, diagnostic software, and other miscellaneous lab electronics.
In many cases the acquired data are returned in tabular form as [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames.

## Getting started with `ssmdevices`
### Installation
1. Ensure prerequisites are installed:
    * python (3.9 â€“ 3.13)
    * [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for package management
2. Recommended module installation:
    * For python distributions based on anaconda:
      ```sh
      pip --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed install ssmdevices
      ```
    * For other python installations:
      ```sh
      pip install ssmdevices
      ```

<!-- _Note: Certain commercial equipment, instruments, and software are identified here in order to help specify experimental procedures.  Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement of any product or service by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose._ -->
