## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-30

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Pyside6 module is now being used.
* Virtual environments are now handled by `uv`.
  * It speeds up the creation and updating of Libreflow instances, while also providing greater stability.

    * Support for `poetry` will be removed at the end of August.

### Added

* An option to skip updates in a Libreflow instance.
* When there is only one project assigned to the user, the autostart command-line argument will skip the launcher GUI and start the Libreflow instance instead.
* The launcher can now be used in offline mode when Overseer servers are unreachable.

### Changed

* Projects list loading time has been improved when switching servers and exiting the settings page.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-03-26

### Added

* A new environment variable `PYTHON_MIN_VERSION` is handled in the project configuration to specify a minimum python version requirement for a project.
* A request session is created when a project has the `file_manager.synchronisation` libreflow extension installed.
* A placeholder file with the project name is now created in project folders.
* A project environment variable `LF_PROJECT_NAME` can now be used in a sync and request session, to specify the project name used in libreflow.

### Changed

* `KABARET_FLOW_EXT_INSTALLERS` environment variable is no longer used if there is no extensions assigned to a project.
* The launcher now uses the direct path for python. Especially for using the correct version selected in the settings.
* Poetry path is no longer used. Instead, it calls the Python module to ensure that the correct one is used according to the Python version.
* In the settings, the Python path parameter is now a list and you can add a custom path.
* Checking the Poetry environment of a project has been improved.
  * It makes sure it uses the correct Python version selected in the settings, and that all dependencies are installed.

Initial public commit and pypi setup. This is an early version of Libreflow Launcher.

The user interface is likely to change in the future.
