# Bouquet

## Overview

Bouquet simplifies the process of defining and running a set of services for a beamline. This software defines and
maintains a set of service classes with predefined behaviors and configurations. This allows a user to define the
desired set of services at a high architectural level, and Bouquet will generate the necessary compose file to run the
services.

It is designed to be used with a beamline directory that contains a `beamline_config.yml` file. This file contains the
configuration for the services that will be run in the Compose configuration.

Each service should only require its name (the corresponding key in services) and its service type. Bouquet will
substitute default values for required composition settings as needed. To overwrite these values you simply enter
key/value pairs into the service just as you would a container composition file (e.g. docker-compose.yml).

Bouquet will automatically generate support services as required (e.g. redis, mariadb, mongodb, etc.)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Podman or Docker
- Podman Compose or Docker Compose

### Installing from PyPI

```sh
pip install bouquet
```

### Installing from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/rock-it/wp2/rock-it-starterpack/bouquet
cd bouquet
```

2. Install using Poetry:
```sh
poetry install
```

Or using pip:
```sh
pip install .
```

## Project Architecture

Bouquet is organized into several key components:

### Core Components

- **bouquet.py**: The main entry point that handles command-line arguments and environment variables.
- **compose.py**: Handles the generation of the Podman/Docker Compose configuration.
- **models.py**: Defines the data models for beamline configuration, service configuration, and compose configuration.
- **defaults.py**: Provides default values for various configuration parameters.
- **writing.py**: Handles writing the generated compose file to disk.

### Service Types

The `services/types/` directory contains modules for each supported service type. Each service type module defines a class that inherits from `ServiceConfig` and provides default values and configuration for that service type.

### Data Flow

1. The user provides a beamline configuration file or directory.
2. Bouquet parses the configuration and creates a `BeamlineConfig` object.
3. The `get_compose_config` function converts the `BeamlineConfig` to a `ComposeConfig` object.
4. The `write_compose_file` function writes the `ComposeConfig` to a YAML file.
5. If not in generate-only mode, Bouquet runs the compose file using Podman or Docker.

### Extension

To add a new service type:

1. Create a new module in `services/types/` with a class that inherits from `ServiceConfig`.
2. Add the service type to the `ALLOWED_SERVICE_TYPES` dictionary in `defaults.py`.
3. Implement the necessary configuration in the service type class.

## Features

- Parses environment variables and command-line arguments to configure the script's behavior.
- Generates a Podman or Docker Compose file based on the provided beamline configuration file.
- Starts the services defined in the beamline configuration file with Podman or Docker Compose.
- Supports a variety of service types, including Bluesky queueservers, QT GUIs, and HTTP APIs, Daiquiri, Flint, Redis,
MariaDB, and MongoDB.
- A beamline configuration file can be created to fully define the services to be run. Bouquet will handle necessary
substitutions and configurations.
- `rely_on_traefik` and `apply_traefik_labels` are two options that enable
easy implementation of traefik. The former will automatically add the traefik reverse proxy service and disable exposed ports of other services. The latter will automatically apply pre-defined labels to the services to configure traefik without needing to mount a traefik.yml config file.

## Supported Service Types

Bouquet recognizes the following service types:
- `queueserver`: A service running a Bluesky kernel and queueserver.
- `queueserver_http_api`: A service running a Bluesky queueserver HTTP API.
- `queueserver_qtgui`: A service running a QT GUI for the Bluesky queueserver.
- `bluesky_blissdata`: A service which translates the Bluesky event model to the Blissdata model.
- `daiquiri_bluesky`: A service running the Daiquiri graphical user interface.
- `flint`: A service running the Flint graphical interface to Blissdata.
- `redis`: A service running a Redis server.
- `mariadb`: A service running a MariaDB server.
- `mongodb`: A service running a MongoDB server.
- `jupyterhub`: A jupyterhub service which spawns JupyterLab instances.
- `traefik`: A reverse-proxy service to securely manage network traffic to and from the pod.
- `whoami`: A tiny Go webserver that prints OS information and HTTP request to output. Useful for development.
- `document_proxy`: A service that acts as a proxy for the Bluesky publisher and ZMQ subscriber.
- `tiled`: A service that runs a Tiled server for data access.
- `callback_handler`: A service that runs a RemoteDispatcher and callback handler for Bluesky. This offloads the
                      callback handling from the queueserver to a separate service.

### Service Configuration
Services in Bouquet are meant to be extensions of container composition files (e.g. docker-compose.yml).
This means that you can add any key/value pair that you would normally add to a container composition file to the
service configuration in the beamline configuration file. Bouquet will substitute default values for required
composition settings as needed.

All service types inherit from bouquet.models.`ServiceConfig`

## Releasing to PyPI

This project is configured to automatically publish to PyPI when a new version tag is pushed to the repository. The release process works as follows:

1. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`
2. Commit the changes and push to the repository
3. Create and push a new tag with the format `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v0.3.1`)
