## üöÄ Make Your Remote Server Feel Local

Tired of complex file sync setups? Confused by `rsync`, `scp`, or NFS exports?  
Frustrated when local computing isn't enough ‚Äî but sharing data with a remote server feels like a nightmare?

**`remote_bash` solves this with one simple command.**

With `rbash` or `remote_bash`, you can:

- üîÑ **Mount your local folder** directly into a remote server using a **reverse `sshfs` tunnel**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Run remote code on your data**, just like it's local ‚Äî ideal for training, compiling, debugging, or experimentation
- üîê Skip the hassle of SSH key sharing ‚Äî everything is temporary and secure
- üßº Automatic cleanup after session ends (including keys and mount points)

All without:

- ‚ùå NFS configuration
- ‚ùå Manual SSH forwarding
- ‚ùå Sharing full system access

Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or systems engineer ‚Äî  
**`rbash` makes remote environments feel just like home.**

## Features

- **Automatic local directory mounting** to remote workspace via reverse SSHFS
- **Reverse SSH tunnel** + `sshfs` (no NFS configuration or port forwarding required)
- **Temporary key exchange** with automatic cleanup (no permanent SSH key setup needed)
- **Seamless integration** with your existing `~/.ssh/config`
- **Auto-cleanup** of mounts, keys, and temporary files after session ends
- **Host discovery** from SSH config with tabular output

## Installation

```bash
pip install remote-bash
```

## Quick Start

List available remote hosts from your SSH config:

```bash
rbash
# or
remote_bash
```

Connect to a specific host:

```bash
rbash <hostname>
# or
remote_bash <hostname>
```

The `<hostname>` must be a valid Host entry in your `~/.ssh/config`.

## Example Usage

```bash
rbash myserver
```

This command will:

1. Create a temporary SSH keypair on the remote machine
2. Add the remote public key to your local `authorized_keys`
3. Establish a reverse SSH tunnel to your local machine
4. Mount your current directory to `/home/remote_user/workspaceXXXXXX` on the remote server
5. Drop you into an interactive bash shell on the remote machine

## Requirements

### Local Machine
- Python 3.8+
- `ssh` client
- `sshfs` (FUSE filesystem)

### Remote Machine
- SSH server
- `sshfs` (FUSE filesystem)
- FUSE support enabled

### Installation of Dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install sshfs
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install sshfs
```

**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo yum install sshfs  # CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install sshfs  # Fedora
```

## SSH Configuration

Ensure your `~/.ssh/config` contains the target hosts. Example:

```
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User myuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host production
    HostName prod.example.com
    User deploy
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/prod_key
```

## How It Works

1. **Host Discovery**: Parses your `~/.ssh/config` to find available hosts
2. **Temporary Key Generation**: Creates a temporary SSH keypair on the remote machine
3. **Reverse Tunnel Setup**: Establishes a reverse SSH connection from remote to local
4. **Directory Mounting**: Uses SSHFS to mount your local directory on the remote machine
5. **Interactive Shell**: Drops you into a bash shell with your local files accessible
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes temporary keys, unmounts directories, and cleans up on exit

## Security

- Uses temporary SSH keys that are automatically removed after the session
- No permanent modifications to SSH configurations
- All connections use your existing SSH config and key authentication
- Reverse tunnel is automatically torn down on exit

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
Ensure your SSH key has proper permissions and the remote user has sudo access for FUSE mounting.

### SSHFS Not Found
Install `sshfs` on both local and remote machines using your system's package manager.

### Connection Refused
Verify the host configuration in your `~/.ssh/config` and ensure you can connect manually with `ssh <hostname>`.
