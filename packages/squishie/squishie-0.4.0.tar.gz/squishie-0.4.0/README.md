Squish multiple Pandoc-flavored Markdown files into one super squished document.

## Installation

```sh
python3 -m pip install squishie
```

## Usage

Create a directory with your Markdown files:

```console
$ tree
.
├── doc1.md
└── doc2.md

0 directories, 2 files
```

Each Markdown file should have Pandoc-compatible front matter. For example,
`doc1.md` has the following contents:

```yaml
# doc1.md
---
title: Doc 1
---
This is some text.
```

Add a squishie document file to the directory:

```yaml
# config.yaml
title: My squished document
version: "1.2.3"

sections:
  - doc1.md
  - doc2.md
```

Your directory should now look like this:

```console
$ tree
.
├── squishie.yaml
├── doc1.md
└── doc2.md

0 directories, 2 files
```

Run `squishie` with the `-c`/`--config` option to render the final document:

```sh
squishie -c squishie.yaml
```

```console
$ squishie -c squishie.yaml
---
title: My squished document
version: 1.2.3
---

# Doc 1

This is some text.

# Doc 2

This is different text.
```

Add the `-o`/`--output` option to write the output to a file:

```sh
squishie -c squishie.yaml -o my-squished-document.md
```

It is also possible to add subsections:

```yaml
sections:
  # ...
  - title: Subsection
    sections:
      - doc3.md

      - title: Subsubsection
        sections:
          - doc4.md
```

The header level of a document is automatically adjusted based on the document's
position in the overall section tree.
