## Overview

An app for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot), extending the core models with BGP-specific models. They enable modeling and management of BGP peerings, whether or not the peer device is present in Nautobot.

> The initial development of this app was sponsored by Riot Games, Inc.
