# Pysimmods

This projects contains a collection of (python) simulation models for a variety of energy generation and consumption units. Most of the models were originally developed in the context of the research project iHEM (intelligent Home Energy Management) or other projects at OFFIS. Other models were developed during a student project group at the University of Oldenburg. The models are intended to be used with the co-simulation framework mosaik (https://mosaik.offis.de), but are also usable without mosaik.
