    Computes the Jitter (perturbation in fundamental frequency) of a voice signal.

    Jitter measures the cycle-to-cycle variations in the fundamental period (pitch).
    It is often used as an indicator of vocal fold pathology.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveform : torch.Tensor
        Mono audio waveform tensor. Expected shape: (num_samples,) or (1, num_samples).
    sample_rate : int
        Sampling rate of the waveform.
    f0_min : float
        Minimum fundamental frequency (Hz) to consider for pitch tracking.
    f0_max : float
        Maximum fundamental frequency (Hz) to consider for pitch tracking.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Jitter percentage (Jitter_abs / average_period * 100) or 0.0 if no valid pitch.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a simplified implementation. Accurate jitter calculation requires
    precise fundamental frequency (F0) extraction for each glottal cycle.
    A robust pitch tracking algorithm (e.g., pYIN, RAPT, CREPE) is essential.
    This function provides a conceptual outline.
