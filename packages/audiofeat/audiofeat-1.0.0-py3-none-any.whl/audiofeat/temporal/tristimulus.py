    """
    Computes the tristimulus of an audio waveform.

    Tristimulus is a measure of the spectral balance of a sound,
    often used in musical acoustics. It is based on the relative
    strengths of the fundamental, the second harmonic, and the
    higher harmonics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveform : torch.Tensor
        Mono audio waveform tensor. Expected shape: (num_samples,) or (1, num_samples).
    sample_rate : int
        Sampling rate of the waveform.
    n_fft : int
        Size of the FFT window.
    hop_length : int
        Number of samples between successive frames.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        A tensor of shape (3,) representing the tristimulus values (T1, T2, T3).

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation assumes the input waveform is a single channel.
    For multi-channel audio, you might need to process each channel
    separately or average them.
    Requires 'torch' and 'torchaudio' to be installed.
