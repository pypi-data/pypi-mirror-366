# Overview

We assume some basic knowledge about how to use `numpy` [numpy-documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)

`numqi` is a toolbox for various kind of quantum information tasks, like entanglement detection, quantum error correction code, quantum state tomography, etc. It is based on `numpy` and `pytorch` and is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend.

We recommend to use `import numqi` for importing the toolbox.
