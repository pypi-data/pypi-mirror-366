- Developers often skip or inadequately document project requirements and technical guidelines
- Inconsistent documentation quality across projects
- Lack of structured approach to application design and planning

**Impact:**
- Projects start without clear requirements or technical direction
- Poor documentation leads to scope creep and technical debt
- Team onboarding is slow due to inadequate project documentation
- Inconsistent development practices across projects

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Secondary Goals
- **Minimal Maintenance Overhead**: Ensure generated documentation requires little to no ongoing updates
- **Simple Standardization**: Establish basic, consistent patterns that are easy to follow
- **Focused AI Assistance**: Use Claude to generate only essential content, avoiding feature bloat

### Success Metrics
- Time to generate complete project documentation: < 15 minutes
- Documentation completeness score: > 90% (compared to manual creation)
- User adoption rate: 80% of target developers use tool for new projects
- User satisfaction score: > 4.5/5.0

## 4. Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Individual Developers**: Solo developers starting new projects
- **Technical Leads**: Engineers responsible for project architecture and documentation
- **Product Managers**: PMs needing to create comprehensive PRDs

### Secondary Users
- **Development Teams**: Teams needing standardized project documentation
- **Consultants**: Technical consultants designing applications for clients
- **Students/Educators**: Learning proper project documentation practices

## 5. User Stories and Requirements

### Core User Stories

**US-1: Application Design Questionnaire**
```
As a developer starting a new project,
I want to answer a series of contextual questions about my application,
So that I can define clear requirements and technical specifications.
```

**US-2: Document Generation**
```
As a project lead,
I want to automatically generate PRD, CLAUDE.md, and README files,
So that I have comprehensive project documentation without manual effort.
```

**US-3: Interactive CLI Experience**
```
As a user,
I want a rich, interactive terminal experience with clear prompts and options,
So that the questionnaire process is engaging and easy to follow.
```

**US-4: Adaptive Questioning**
```
As a user answering questions,
I want follow-up questions based on my previous answers,
So that the tool captures relevant details for my specific use case.
```

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Questionnaire System
- Generate 3-5 essential multiple-choice questions using Claude Code SDK
- Minimal follow-up questions to avoid complexity
- Collect core application details: type, primary features, and basic tech preferences

### FR-2: Document Generation
- **PRD Generation**: Concise summary, core goals, essential requirements - avoiding over-specification
- **CLAUDE.md Generation**: Simple development rules, basic commands, minimal maintenance workflows
- **README Generation**: Clear installation steps, basic usage, minimal feature description - no unnecessary complexity

### FR-3: CLI Interface
- Simple, clean terminal interface with minimal visual complexity
- Straightforward command structure: `claude-designer design [options]`
- Basic options to customize output without feature bloat
- Concise summary display with simple confirmation
- Essential error handling without over-engineering

### FR-4: File Management
- Save generated documents to specified output directory
- Support custom output paths
- Preserve existing files with user confirmation
- Proper file encoding (UTF-8) and formatting

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Question generation: < 5 seconds per question set
- Document generation: < 30 seconds for all three documents
- Total process completion: < 10 minutes including user interaction

### Reliability
- 99% uptime dependency on Claude Code SDK availability
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Data persistence during process interruption

### Usability
- Intuitive command structure following CLI best practices
- Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
- Rich formatting for improved readability
- Keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)

### Compatibility
- Python 3.11+ support
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Claude Code SDK integration
- Standard terminal environments

## 8. Technical Constraints

### Dependencies
- Claude Code SDK (primary AI integration)
- Click (CLI framework)
- Rich (terminal formatting)
- Pydantic (data validation)

### Architecture Constraints
- Simple async/await pattern for SDK interactions
- Minimal modular design - avoid over-abstraction
- Essential type hints following KISS principle
- Basic linting compliance without excessive rules

### Integration Constraints
- Requires Claude Code CLI installation
- API rate limits from Anthropic
- Network connectivity requirement
- Authentication via Claude Code SDK

## 11. Design Philosophy

**Simplicity First**: Every feature is evaluated against the principle of minimal maintenance and maximum clarity. We prioritize:

- **Minimal Configuration**: Sensible defaults over extensive customization options
- **Essential Features Only**: Avoid feature creep that increases maintenance overhead
- **Clear, Maintainable Code**: Simple implementations over clever abstractions
- **Focused Scope**: Generate only the documentation that provides immediate value
- **Low Maintenance Dependencies**: Choose stable, well-maintained libraries with minimal dependencies
