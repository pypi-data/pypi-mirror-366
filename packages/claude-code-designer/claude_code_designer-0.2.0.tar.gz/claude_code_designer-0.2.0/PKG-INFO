## How It's Built

- **`models.py`**: Defines what data we collect and how we validate it
- **`questionnaire.py`**: Handles the conversation with users and collects their answers
- **`generator.py`**: Takes those answers and creates beautiful documents
- **`cli.py`**: The command-line interface that ties everything together

## Want to Help?

**Our Philosophy**: Every change should make things simpler, not more complicated.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Make a small, focused improvement
3. Test that your change works
4. Clean up your code with: `uv run ruff check --fix .`
5. Send us a pull request

### What We Value

- **Simple Solutions**: We prefer code that's easy to understand over code that's clever
- **Focused Features**: We say "no" to most new features to keep things simple
- **Easy Maintenance**: Every line of code needs to be maintained forever
- **Keep It Simple**: Simple code beats fancy design patterns every time

## Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** - The programming language we're built on
- **Claude Code SDK** - How we talk to Claude AI
- **Click 8.1+** - Makes our command-line interface nice to use
- **Rich 13.0+** - Adds colors and formatting to the terminal
- **Pydantic 2.0+** - Helps us validate data properly
