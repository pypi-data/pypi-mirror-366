It *beeps* happy birthday to you using your internal speaker.

Usage: `birthday Turtle` (normal) , `birthday` (no name), `birthday -f Turtle` (fast mode)

Requirements: A PC with an internal beeper, Linux, and the beep package (use dnf/apt install).

If you're using Linux, simply pip install it.
If you're using Windows, first set up WSL and install this package in there, then run the command.
If you're using MacOS, Sorry. Use a VM.
