"""
CausalTorch: Causal Neural-Symbolic Generative Networks
======================================================

A PyTorch library for building generative models with causal constraints.
Built on core architecture principles:

1. PyTorch Foundation → CausalTorch Core → Specialized Modules
2. Standalone operation for from-scratch and fine-tuning scenarios  
3. Integrated causal reasoning engine as central hub
4. Intervention API, Counterfactual Engine, and Causal Regularization

Key components:
- CausalTorch Core: Foundation for all causal AI models
- From-Scratch Model Building: Build causal models from ground up
- Pre-trained Model Fine-tuning: Add causality to existing models
- Causal Reasoning Engine: Central hub for causal inference
- Intervention API: Perform causal interventions (do-calculus)
- Counterfactual Engine: Generate "what-if" scenarios
- Causal Regularization: Training stability and consistency
