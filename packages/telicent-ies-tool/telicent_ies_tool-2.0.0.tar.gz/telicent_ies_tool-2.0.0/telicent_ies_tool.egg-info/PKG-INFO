           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

# telicent-ies-tool

A library for working with the [IES data standard.](https://github.com/dstl/IES4)

IES is a UK Government data exchange standard. It is a 4D ontology specified as an RDF Schema. The purpose 
of telicent-ies-tool is to make it easier for users to create compliant IES data.

Formal ontologies can be hard for beginners to grasp. Unlike traditional data models, they are constructional
in nature. Instead of defining a set of entities and fields to populate, ontologies like IES define a set of
common objects that can be assembled following well-defined patterns. This introduces a degree of flexibility
not found in traditional data models, which is great for real-world situations where information requirements
change faster than the data models can be re-engineered. The disadvantage to this approach is that if users
and developers are not steeped in the principles that underpin the ontology (4D, extensional, constructional)
then it is possible to generate structures that do not follow the patterns. We can mitigate this somewhat with
the use of SHACL, but overuse of SHACL would result in the loss of desired flexibility.

To counter some of these issues, Telicent have collected together a number of convenience functions that we
have used on projects into one Python library to help data engineers get started and hopefully ensure 
appropriate use of the ontology. This is work in progress, and we want to hear from users about what is 
missing / not working, and of course requests for new features. We will continue to add functionality as we
identify the requirement in customer projects. 


## Dependencies

Python >= 3.8

## Install

```shell
pip install telicent-ies-tool
```

## Overview & Approach

The IES Tool has a main factory class - `IESTool` - that takes care of storage, caching, and Python object instantiation. 
This will be automatically initiated as the default `IES_TOOL` constant which can be imported It is necessary to initiate
a tool object for every dataset you wish to work with. 

```python
from ies_tool.ies_tool import IESTool, IES_TOOL
```

As well as the main factory class, and the default instance of the tool (IES_TOOL), there are base Python classes for all
the significant IES classes:

Each of these classes can be instantiated using typical Pythonic approach - e.g. 
```python
anne = Person(given_name="Anne", surname="Smith")
```
Note that the default IES_TOOL instance will be used unless you specify the `tool=` parameter in the class initiation you're using
so it knows where to create the RDF data. It is recommended that this approach is used in most cases. 

However, data can also be created using the `instantiate()` method on IESTool, the tool will attempt to determine the most
appropriate Python base class to initiate - e.g.

```python
fred = tool.instantiate(classes=['http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#Person'])
```
The 'fred' object returned will be a Python Person object. It's generally better to just initiate the classes directly, as
it is not always possible to deterministically infer the Python class from the `instantiate()` call. Developers can override
the inference by setting the `base_class` parameter - e.g.


## Usage

To import, use:

```python
from ies_tool.ies_tool import IESTool, IES_TOOL
```

This will import a pre-initiated IESTool object that is ready to use, and will be the default factory object for all other classes

To manually instantiate another tool (factory) object:

```python
tool = IESTool()
```




### Creating Data

#### Person
To create a person we need to instantiate a `Person` object first. We can pass in several parameters, but the only mandatory one is the `tool` 
parameter which refers to the IESTool factory object being used. The instantiated person graph will be stored in tool dataset.

```python
my_person = Person(
    given_name='Fred',
    surname='Smith',
    date_of_birth="1985-08-21"
)
```
Note that `start` is used for the date of birth as this is inherited from Element. This person instance will be created in the default IES_TOOL.

We can then add additional information associated with the person using one of the available methods such as 
`add_identifier()`, `add_state()`, `in_location()`, `works_for()` etc.

The data produced from the example above will be:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.com/rdf/testdata#> .
@prefix ies: <http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#> .
@prefix iso8601: <http://iso.org/iso8601#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

iso8601:1985-08-21 a ies:ParticularPeriod ;
    ies:iso8601PeriodRepresentation "1985-08-21"^^xsd:string .
```

Note that the URIs are generated automatically (UUIDs appended to the default data namespace) unless the uri parameter is used to manually set them.

### Extending the IES Ontology
If you plan to use new subclasses in your data, it helps to register those new classes (and their supertypes) with IES Tool. This will enable the tool to make better inference of base Python classes. The extensions are added as a dictionary where the key is the URI of the new class, and the value is a list of the new class's superclasses:

```python
ADDITONAL_CLASSES = {
    "http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#Widget": ['http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#Device'],
    "http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#Gizmo": ['http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#Device']
}

tool = IESTool()
tool.add_classes(ADDITONAL_CLASSES)
```

### Low-level operations (RDF / RDFS)
The base classes provide some simple methods for creating predicates:

```python
my_person.add_literal(predicate="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",literal="Fred Smith")
my_person.add_label("Freddy")
my_person.add_comment("The one and only Fred Smith")
my_person.add_telicent_primary_name("SMITH, Fred")
my_person.add_related_object(predicate="http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#ancestorOf",related_object=my_other_person)
```

The IES tool itself also provides a set of low-level methods for working with the graph, such as `add_triple` which adds an RDF statement:

```python
IES_TOOL.add_triple(
    subject=my_person.uri,
    predicate='http://ies.data.gov.uk/ontology/ies4#hasCharacteristic',
    obj=characteristic_uri
)
```

### Namespaces

To bind an RDF namespace prefix, we need to 'register' that prefix. The library pre-configures prefixes: 
`xsd:`, `dc:`, `rdf:`, `rdfs:`, `owl:`, `ies:`, `iso8601:`, `iso3166:`

Registering these prefixes just enables shorter, more readable RDF to be produced. The methods in the IES tool itself all
require fully expanded URIs. 

```python
from ies_tool.ies_tool import IES_TOOL


IES_TOOL.add_prefix("data:", "http://example.com/rdf/testdata#")
```

As a default `http://example.com/rdf/testdata#` is used as a default data namespace. This can be changed: 

```python
IES_TOOL.uri_stub = 'http://mydomain.org/rdf-data#'
```
Note this will also set the blank prefix `:` to `http://mydomain.org/rdf-data#`

### Saving/creating RDF

#### As a text string

```python
my_rdf_string = IES_TOOL.get_rdf(format="turtle") 
```
As the IES tool uses RDFLib by default. If another storage plug-in has been used, it may not support all the RDF bindings.

#### Saving RDF locally

```python
IES_TOOL.save_rdf("path/to/my/file.ttl", rdf_format="ttl")  
```

### To clear the graph:

```python
IES_TOOL.clear_graph()
```
