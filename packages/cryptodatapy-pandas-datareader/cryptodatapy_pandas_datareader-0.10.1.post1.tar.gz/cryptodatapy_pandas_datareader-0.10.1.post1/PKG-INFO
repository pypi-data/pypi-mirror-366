        The PyData Development Team is the collection of developers of the PyData
        project. This includes all of the PyData sub-projects, including pandas. The
        core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:

        Our Copyright Policy
        ====================
        
        PyData uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to PyData. However, it is important to note that
        these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
        the PyData source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
        person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
        entire PyData Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
        a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
        they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
        when they commit the change to one of the PyData repositories.
        
        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
        file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
