# ITACaRT - v0.1.0a3

**PyPI package name reserved. This is a placeholder for the official reference implementation.**

ITACaRT (ITA Cadastral Ellipsoidal Reference Tessellation) is an equal-area parallelogram Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) designed for terrestrial cadastral mapping, usability, and blockchain integration.

This project was developed at the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) and is detailed in the scientific paper:

> [Silva, I. N., Shiguemori, E. H., & Dietzsch, G. (2025). *Designing a parallelogram Discrete Global Grid System for terrestrial cadastral mapping.*](http://mtc-m16c.sid.inpe.br/col/sid.inpe.br/mtc-m16c/2025/06.04.13.53/doc/thisInformationItemHomePage.html)

The full conceptual methodology can be found in the article. This package will host the future reference implementation, including algorithms for coordinate transformations, indexing, and topological queries as outlined in the "Future Work" section of the paper.

### Key Features (as per design)
- **Purpose-Oriented:** Designed for cadastral mapping needs.
- **Equal-Area Cells:** Ensures uniform cell sizes based on a sinusoidal projection on the ellipsoid.
- **GNSS Compatibility:** Based on the WGS84 ellipsoid with resolutions down to 1 cm.
- **Compositional Hierarchical Indexing:** A human-readable index designed to represent complex vector features.

**Stay tuned for future development!**
