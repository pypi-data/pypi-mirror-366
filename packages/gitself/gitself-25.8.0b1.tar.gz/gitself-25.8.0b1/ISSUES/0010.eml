We should be able to do `gitself reply #`  and quickly reply to an

I'm pretty sure that I want to make the reply use a from/date header. I
might be able to use a multipart email instead of mbox format? I'm not
really sure which one will work better. I don't think that I really need
anything more than From/Date. Other header values are fine I just don't
really /need/ them. Multipart would avoid some shenanigans. And I guess
you *could* have multipart within the multipart...

Okay so now I'm getting the right file but... why are the line endings
all weird? Because it's technically a message? But... I don't think
that's right...

Okay so I think I got this sorted in that it was the editing. Or I guess
more accurately: Linux line endings are `\n` while RFC2822 line endings
are `\r\n` and that's what was causing the hinkiness. We'll see if I can
write the file as-is or if I have to use a temp file, read/parse the
email(s) and move them into the new issue. Let's try!

Okay cool, looks like that worked! I think the 'print' commands were
doing some silliness.
