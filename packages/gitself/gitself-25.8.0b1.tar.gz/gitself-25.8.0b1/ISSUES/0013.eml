Subject: Does forgefed have any ideas we can ~steal~ implement?
Message-ID: 0013@yourproject

ForgeFed: https://forgefed.org/

Specification: https://forgefed.org/spec/#kinds-of-objects

https://codeberg.org/ForgeFed/ForgeFed/src/branch/main/doc/EXAMPLE_WORKFLOWS.md

Looks like, at a glance of the specification, that there's way too much
stuff there. Pewps.

lines???
