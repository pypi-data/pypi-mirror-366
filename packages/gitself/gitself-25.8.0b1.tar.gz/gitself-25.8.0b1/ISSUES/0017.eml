Subject: Rewrite to class-based approach
Message-ID: 0017@yourproject

I think it's pretty obvious to myself at this point that the class-based
approach is a good one. Something like:


    class Issue:
        def __init__(self, path):
            self.path = path
            self._parsed = HEADER_PARSER.parse(self.path)

        @property
        def number(self):
            return int(self._parsed['Message-ID'])

        def edit(self, autocommit=False):
            ...

        def close(self):
            ...

        def reply(self):
            ...

Might want to include `attrs` but not positive. Would make sorting less
writing but not sure if it would be better to skip the extra dependency.
