Subject: Add tests
Message-ID: 0014@yourproject

I think we're probably at a point where I can go ahead and add tests. I
think that the flow that I want to do is an overall test flow; might be
some particulars, but something like:

- start with no files
- gitself init should create gitself/INBOX and gitself/ISSUES, though
  the INBOX and ISSUES path(s) should be configured via settings. There
  should also be a `closed_path` if we want to hide those. If closing
  is moving to a different path then we should change the status in one
  commit and then move in a second commit.
- creating new issues should put them in the INBOX with commit
- accepting issue should change the id in a commit and move to the ISSUES
  folder in a second commit
- closing an issue should set the status to closed
- replying to an issue should add the other parts -- maybe multipart?
  maybe mbox?
- issues without closed status should be open
- when there are more issues that zfill, we should be able to
  bulk-rename all the issues.
- html rendering should filter by inbox, open, and closed

I think that's mainly it? Maybe have some `gitself contributor` urls or
something for doing a `git fetch remote-1 remote-2` something like that.
