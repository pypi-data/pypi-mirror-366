Subject: Auto-commit on issue creation (unless flag is passed)
Message-ID: 0005@yourproject

Probably something like `--no-commit`; otherwise we should automatically
make a commit with:

`Create issue "blah blah bla.."` where we truncate the title if the
total message would be >72(?) characters.

Does it make sense to add the issue contents to the commit message to?
Probably not. But maybe some other data. Makes me wonder a bit why we
couldn't just go ahead and make the issue reporting in a commit message,
but... maybe there's a size limit to the commit messages. Might not be a
bad way though. I dunno, requires some thinking!
