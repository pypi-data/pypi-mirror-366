Subject: Add mermaid/markdown rendering for HTML output
Message-ID: 0015@yourproject

What is says on the tin.

HTML output is good. We want to at the very least use
http://mermaid.js.org to display charts on the rendered HTML. There's
probably some other useful bits & pieces, but that part at the very
least is good.
