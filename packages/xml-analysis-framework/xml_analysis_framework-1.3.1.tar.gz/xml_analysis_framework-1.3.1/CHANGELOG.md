## [1.2.7] - 2025-01-26

### Fixed
- **Reverted Breaking Change**: Removed inheritance relationship between SpecializedAnalysis and DocumentTypeInfo
  - The inheritance approach would have required updating all 29 handlers
  - Restored original SpecializedAnalysis structure to maintain compatibility
  - The API harmonization from v1.2.6 still works perfectly without inheritance

### Note
- The chunking harmonization from v1.2.6 remains intact and functional
- `chunk_document()` still accepts results directly from `analyze_document()` without conversion

## [1.2.6] - 2025-01-26

### Fixed
- **API Harmonization**: Fixed inconsistency between `analyze_document` return format and `chunk_document` expected format
  - `chunk_document()` now accepts `DocumentTypeInfo` objects directly from `analyze_document()` results
  - No more manual format conversion needed for expert usage
  - Maintains backward compatibility with dictionary format
  - Updated docstring to clarify the accepted formats
  - Added proper handling in `_select_strategy()` and `_post_process_chunks()` for both object and dict formats

### Changed
- **Expert Usage**: Simplified advanced usage examples - `chunk_document()` now works directly with `analyze_document()` results
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md to reflect the harmonized API
- **Data Model**: Extended `SpecializedAnalysis` to inherit from `DocumentTypeInfo` for future API improvements
  - Added `to_dict()` method for backward compatibility
  - Prepared foundation for v2.0 unified API

### Developer Notes
- **Future v2.0**: Full migration planned where `analyze_document()` will return `SpecializedAnalysis` objects directly
- **Confidence Levels**: Preserved throughout the API as they're valuable for handler selection and transparency

## [1.2.5] - 2025-01-26

  - Added error handling in enhanced analysis example for when quality_metrics is None
  - Fixed variable name in CONTRIBUTING.md from `analysis` to `result` for consistency
  - Corrected method signature for `chunk_document()` to include required `strategy` parameter

### Changed
- **Examples**: All advanced usage examples now use correct method signatures and imports
