# Synapse SDK Development Guide

Always follow the instructions in plan.md. When I say "go", find the next unmarked test in plan.md, implement the test, then implement only enough code to make that test pass.

## Overall Engineering Principle

### ROLE AND EXPERTISE

You are a senior software engineer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. Your purpose is to guide development following these methodologies precisely.

### CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
- Write the simplest failing test first
- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are passing
- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes
- Maintain high code quality throughout development

### TDD METHODOLOGY GUIDANCE

- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- Make test failures clear and informative
- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed
- Repeat the cycle for new functionality
- When fixing a defect, first write an API-level failing test then write the smallest possible test that replicates the problem then get both tests to pass.

### TIDY FIRST APPROACH

- Separate all changes into two distinct types:
  1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

### COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- Only commit when:
  1. ALL tests are passing
  2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved
  3. The change represents a single logical unit of work
  4. Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

### CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

### REFACTORING GUIDELINES

- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity

### EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

When approaching a new feature:

1. Write a simple failing test for a small part of the feature
2. Implement the bare minimum to make it pass
3. Run tests to confirm they pass (Green)
4. Make any necessary structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each change
5. Commit structural changes separately
6. Add another test for the next small increment of functionality
7. Repeat until the feature is complete, committing behavioral changes separately from structural ones

Follow this process precisely, always prioritizing clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

Always write one test at a time, make it run, then improve structure. Always run all the tests (except long-running tests) each time.

## Project Core Features

## üìö Documentation Management

The project uses **Docusaurus** for documentation with a structured approach:

### Documentation Structure

- **Implementation**: `synapse_sdk/devtools/docs/` - Docusaurus application
- **Content**: `docs/` - Markdown documentation files
- **Configuration**: `synapse_sdk/devtools/docs/docusaurus.config.ts`

```

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Content Creation**: Add/edit `.md` files in `docs/`

  sidebar_position: 1
  ---
  ```
- Follow existing structure for API docs in `docs/api/`
- Add code examples in appropriate language blocks
- Include cross-references using relative paths

## üîß Code Formatting with Ruff

Claude Code should format all Python code changes using **Ruff** to maintain consistent code style across the project.

### When to Format Code

- **Before committing**: Always format code before creating commits
- **After code changes**: Format immediately after writing or modifying Python code
- **During code reviews**: Ensure all code follows consistent formatting standards

### Ruff Commands

```bash
# Format all Python files in the project
ruff format .

# Format specific file
ruff format path/to/file.py

# Check for formatting issues without applying changes
ruff format --check .

# Check and fix linting issues
ruff check --fix .

# Check linting without fixing
ruff check .
```

### Formatting Workflow

1. **Make code changes** - Write or modify Python code
2. **Format with Ruff** - Run `ruff format .` to apply consistent formatting
3. **Fix linting issues** - Run `ruff check --fix .` to resolve code quality issues
4. **Verify changes** - Review the formatted code to ensure it's correct
5. **Commit changes** - Create commits with properly formatted code

### Integration with Development

- **IDE Setup**: Configure your IDE to run Ruff on save
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use Ruff in pre-commit hooks to enforce formatting
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Include Ruff checks in continuous integration

### Ruff Configuration

The project uses Ruff configuration defined in `pyproject.toml`:

- **Line length**: Follow project-specific line length settings
- **Import sorting**: Automatic import organization and sorting
- **Code style**: Consistent formatting rules across the codebase
- **Linting rules**: Comprehensive code quality checks

### Best Practices

- **Run before commit**: Always run `ruff format .` and `ruff check --fix .` before committing
- **Review changes**: Check that Ruff's changes don't alter code logic
- **Consistent style**: Let Ruff handle formatting so you can focus on functionality
- **Team consistency**: Ensures all contributors follow the same code style

## Code Review Rules

Code review rules are organized by priority level and stored in separate files for better maintainability and modularity.

### Priority Levels

- **[P1_rules.md](P1_rules.md)** - Security and Stability (Critical)
- **[P2_rules.md](P2_rules.md)** - Core Functionality (High)  
- **[P3_rules.md](P3_rules.md)** - Best Practices (Medium)
- **[P4_rules.md](P4_rules.md)** - Code Style (Low)

### Using the Review Rules

1. **Start with P1**: Address security and stability issues first
2. **Progress through priorities**: P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4
3. **Use review-pr command**: `synapse review pr` loads and displays all rules automatically
4. **Reference specific files**: Review individual priority files as needed

### Required Checklist Before Review

**Before submitting for review, ensure:**

```bash
# 1. Format all Python code
ruff format .

# 2. Fix linting issues
ruff check --fix .

# 3. Verify no remaining issues
ruff check .

# 4. Run all tests
pytest

# 5. Check test coverage
pytest --cov=synapse_sdk
