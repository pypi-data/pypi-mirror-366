Async ProjectX Realtime Client for ProjectX Gateway API

This module provides an async Python client for the ProjectX real-time API, which provides
access to the ProjectX trading platform real-time events via SignalR WebSocket connections.

Key Features:
- Full async/await support for all operations
- Asyncio-based connection management
- Non-blocking event processing
- Async callbacks for all events

    """
    Async real-time client for ProjectX Gateway API WebSocket connections.

    This class provides an async interface for ProjectX SignalR connections and
    forwards all events to registered managers. It does NOT cache data or perform
    business logic - that's handled by the specialized managers.

    Features:
        - Async SignalR WebSocket connections to ProjectX Gateway hubs
        - Event forwarding to registered async managers
        - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
        - JWT token refresh and reconnection
        - Connection health monitoring
        - Async event callbacks

    Architecture:
        - Pure event forwarding (no business logic)
        - No data caching (handled by managers)
        - No payload parsing (managers handle ProjectX formats)
        - Minimal stateful operations

    Real-time Hubs (per ProjectX Gateway docs):
        - User Hub: Account, position, and order updates
        - Market Hub: Quote, trade, and market depth data

    Example:
        >>> # Create async client with ProjectX Gateway URLs
        >>> client = AsyncProjectXRealtimeClient(jwt_token, account_id)
        >>> # Register async managers for event handling
        >>> await client.add_callback("position_update", position_manager.handle_update)
        >>> await client.add_callback("order_update", order_manager.handle_update)
        >>> await client.add_callback("quote_update", data_manager.handle_quote)
        >>>
        >>> # Connect and subscribe
        >>> if await client.connect():
        ...     await client.subscribe_user_updates()
        ...     await client.subscribe_market_data(["CON.F.US.MGC.M25"])

    Event Types (per ProjectX Gateway docs):
        User Hub: GatewayUserAccount, GatewayUserPosition, GatewayUserOrder, GatewayUserTrade
        Market Hub: GatewayQuote, GatewayDepth, GatewayTrade

    Integration:
        - AsyncPositionManager handles position events and caching
        - AsyncOrderManager handles order events and tracking
        - AsyncRealtimeDataManager handles market data and caching
        - This client only handles connections and event forwarding

        Initialize async ProjectX real-time client with configurable SignalR connections.

                If provided, takes precedence over config URL.

            2. Config URLs (config.user_hub_url, config.market_hub_url)
            3. Default TopStepX endpoints

        Clean up resources when shutting down.

        Performs complete cleanup of the real-time client, including disconnecting
        from hubs and clearing all callbacks. Should be called when the client is
        no longer needed.

        Cleanup Operations:
            1. Disconnect from both SignalR hubs
            2. Clear all registered callbacks
            3. Reset connection state

        Example:
            >>> # Basic cleanup
            >>> await client.cleanup()
            >>>
            >>> # In a context manager (if implemented)
            >>> async with AsyncProjectXRealtimeClient(token, account) as client:
            ...     await client.connect()
            ...     # ... use client ...
            ... # cleanup() called automatically
            >>>
            >>> # In a try/finally block
            >>> client = AsyncProjectXRealtimeClient(token, account)
            >>> try:
            ...     await client.connect()
            ...     await client.subscribe_user_updates()
            ...     # ... process events ...
            >>> finally:
            ...     await client.cleanup()

        Note:
            - Safe to call multiple times
            - After cleanup, client must be recreated for reuse
            - Does not affect the JWT token or account ID
