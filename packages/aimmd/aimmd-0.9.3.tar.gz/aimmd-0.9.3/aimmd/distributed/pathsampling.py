            same length as we have/want `PathChainSampler`s, the inner lists
            can be of different lenght for each sampler and contain different
            `PathMover`s (just take care that the weights match the movers).

        Reinitialize the `Brain` from an existing working/simulation directory.

        This method first finds all finished steps and adds them to the `Brain`
        and storage in the order they have originally been produced (using the
        mtime from the operating system). It then searches for any unfinished
        steps and finishes them before adding them to the storage and `Brain`.

        If `run_tasks` is True (the default) the `Brain` will run all attached
        `BrainTask`s (like density collection and training) for all steps it
        adds as if they would have been just simulated.

        This method can be used to restart a crashed or otherwise prematurely
        terminated simulation to a new storage. In this case the `Brain` should
        be initialized exactly as at the start of the originial simulation when
        calling this function, i.e. with `movers`, `workdir`, etc. set but no
        steps have been performed yet.
        This method can also be used to restart a simulation with a different
        descriptor_transform and/or reaction coordinate model architecture.
        Note that also in this case the `Brain` needs to be initialized very
        similar to what you originaly had set when starting the simulation.
        For more details on what can be changed and what not please consult the
        example notebooks and the documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        run_tasks : bool, optional
            If we should run the `BrainTask`s, by default True
        finish_steps : bool, optional
            If we should finish the unfinished steps, by default False.
            If False, we will put the unfinished steps into the respective
            samplers and finish/continue them as soon as we run again.
            NOTE, that it can be beneficial to set finish_steps=False if you
            intend to add more steps than the unfinished ones.
            You would then call `run_for_n_steps` or `run_for_n_accepts`
            directly after this function with the amount of steps/accepts you
            want to add. The benefit of this strategy is that the new and the
            unfinished steps will then be done concurrently, instead of waiting
            for the unfinished steps to be done and then after they are all
            done start the new steps.
        resave_mcstep_pckl : bool, optional
            Whether we should rewrite the MCStep pickle file, by default False.
            This can be useful e.g. to update all python objects to a new
            version of aimmd/asyncmd or to update all filepaths/workdirs after
            moving the simulation.
            Note that the previous mcstep pickle files will be moved and not
            overwritten.
