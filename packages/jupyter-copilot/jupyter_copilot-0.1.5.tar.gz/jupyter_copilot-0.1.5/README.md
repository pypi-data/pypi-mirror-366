# jupyter_copilot

[PyPi Package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-copilot/)

A GitHub Copilot extension for JupyterLab. This extension uses the language server provided by [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) and the [@jupyter/completer](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/completer.html) module to provide native GitHub Copilot autocomplete into notebooks.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: You should not use this for remote notebooks over SSH as authentication for the extension server  is currently disabled. Also, This extension also only supports JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook 7 but not the Classic Notebook (v6)**

**This extension is still very new and may be rough around the edges. If you experience any bugs or have any feature requests please feel free to open an issue or make a PR :)**

Once signed in open any notebook and the extension should run!

## Settings

To change settings go to `Settings > Settings Editor` then search for Copilot.

| Accept Keybind | The keybind you want to use to accept a completion, default value is `Ctrl + J`. This setting is just a string and is not validated to see if works. Currently using `Tab` for completions does not work, and you must refresh the notebook to see changes in effect. |

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyter_copilot
```

## Troubleshoot

If you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check
that the server extension is enabled:

```bash
jupyter server extension list
```

If the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing
the frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# First install jupyterlab with pip
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyter_copilot directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e "."
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode
jupyter server extension enable jupyter_copilot
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Development uninstall

```bash
# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode
jupyter server extension disable jupyter_copilot
pip uninstall jupyter_copilot
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyter_copilot` within that folder.

### Layout and structure

![https://github.com/baolong281/jupyter-copilot/blob/656c425c9956eb1563a3f90990e0b270ebff725f/imgs/diagram.png](https://github.com/baolong281/jupyter-copilot/blob/656c425c9956eb1563a3f90990e0b270ebff725f/imgs/diagram.png?raw=true)

This extension is composed of a Python package named `jupyter_copilot`
for the server extension and a NPM package named `jupyter_copilot`
for the frontend extension.

The extension uses the language server provided by [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) for authentication and to actually fetch completions from GitHub. The language server is packaged as a node module caleld [copilot-node-server](https://github.com/jfcherng/copilot-node-server).

The frontend is connected to the local extension server via websocket for updates to notebooks and to fetch completions from the LSP server.

## `jupyter_copilot`

This is the code for the local server. `handler.py` has the handles any websocket messages from the frontend through a queue as to not break stuff. The handling of websocket messages is done in `NotebookLSPHandler`. There is another class `NotebookHandler` which creates an in-memory representation of the code from a notebook. This works by having an array for each code block, then indexing into the array and changing its content when theres an update. This class also uses the `lsp_client` to communicate with the LSP server.

The actual node.js Copilot LSP server is spawned in as a process in `lsp.py`. The server is located in `node_modules/copilot-node-server/dist/copilot/language-server.js` and is spawned as. `lsp.py` provides an interface to communicate with this LSP server, and restart if it crashes.

**When you make changes to this folder `npm run watch` will not detect the change, so you need to restart the Jupyter instance in the terminal to see changes take effect**

## TODO

- Completions inside brackets
- Find out a better keybind system
- Copilot chat (?)
- Custom providers (?)
- Port to notebooks (?)
