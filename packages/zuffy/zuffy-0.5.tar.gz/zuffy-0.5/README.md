Zuffy is a python package for exploring Fuzzy Pattern Trees and it is compatible with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).

It aims to provide a simple set of tools for the exploration of FPTs that are induced using 
genetic programming (GP) techniques. The GP functionality is provided by the gplearn library
and the author is grateful to its creator, Trevor Stephens, for his work on this.

Refer to the [documentation](https://zuffy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for further information.

## Setup

Zuffy has been developed and tested with Python 3.11 and these library versions:

  Library    | Version  |
| ---------- | :------: |
| sklearn    | 1.5.2*   |
| numpy      | 1.26.4   |
| pandas     | 2.2.1    |
| matplotlib | 3.9.2    |
| gplearn    | 0.4.2    |

Note that Scikit-learn version 1.6+ modified the API around its "tags" and, until the authors update all their estimators, Zuffy will not run with version 1.6+.  The [gplearn library](https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn), upon which Zuffy has a dependency, has not been updated since 2023.

To display the FPT you will need to install [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).


## Zuffy Installation
Use pip:
> pip install zuffy

or clone the repository:
