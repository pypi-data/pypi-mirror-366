    """A single-use asynchronous response writer for server communication.

    This class provides a thread-safe mechanism for writing and receiving responses
    using an internal asyncio queue with a maximum size of 1. The writer is designed
    for single-use scenarios where only one response can be written and received
    before the writer becomes closed.

    Attributes:
        queue (asyncio.Queue[Response]): Internal queue for storing responses with maxsize=1.
        is_closed (bool): Flag indicating whether the writer has been closed.

    Note:
        The response writer automatically closes after receiving a response,
        making it unsuitable for multiple read/write operations.
