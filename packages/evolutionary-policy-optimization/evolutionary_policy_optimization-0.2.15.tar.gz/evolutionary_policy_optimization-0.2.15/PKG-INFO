## Evolutionary Policy Optimization

Pytorch implementation of [Evolutionary Policy Optimization](https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2503.19037), from [Wang](https://www.jianrenw.com/) et al. of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University

This paper stands out, as I have witnessed the positive effects first hand in an [exploratory project](https://github.com/lucidrains/firefly-torch) (mixing evolution with gradient based methods). Perhaps the Alexnet moment for genetic algorithms has not come to pass yet.

Besides their latent variable strategy, I'll also throw in some attempts with crossover in weight space

## Install

```bash
$ pip install evolutionary-policy-optimization
```

## Usage

```python
import torch

from evolutionary_policy_optimization import (
    LatentGenePool,
    Actor,
    Critic
)

latent_pool = LatentGenePool(
    num_latents = 128,
    dim_latent = 32,
)

state = torch.randn(1, 32)

actor = Actor(dim_state = 32, dim = 256, mlp_depth = 2, num_actions = 4, dim_latent = 32)
critic = Critic(dim_state = 32, dim = 256, mlp_depth = 3, dim_latent = 32)

latent = latent_pool(latent_id = 2)

actions = actor(state, latent)
value = critic(state, latent)

# interact with environment and receive rewards, termination etc

# derive a fitness score for each gene / latent

fitness = torch.randn(128)

latent_pool.genetic_algorithm_step(fitness) # update latent genes with genetic algorithm
```

End to end learning

```python
import torch

from evolutionary_policy_optimization import (
    create_agent,
    EPO,
    Env
)

agent = create_agent(
    dim_state = 512,
    num_latents = 16,
    dim_latent = 32,
    actor_num_actions = 5,
    actor_dim = 256,
    actor_mlp_depth = 2,
    critic_dim = 256,
    critic_mlp_depth = 3,
    latent_gene_pool_kwargs = dict(
        frac_natural_selected = 0.5
    )
)

epo = EPO(
    agent,
    episodes_per_latent = 1,
    max_episode_length = 10,
    action_sample_temperature = 1.
)

env = Env((512,))

epo(agent, env, num_learning_cycles = 5)

# saving and loading

agent.save('./agent.pt', overwrite = True)
agent.load('./agent.pt')
```

## Contributing

At the project root, run

```bash
$ pip install '.[test]' # or `uv pip install '.[test]'`
```

Then add your tests to `tests/test_epo.py` and run

```bash
$ pytest tests/
```

That's it
