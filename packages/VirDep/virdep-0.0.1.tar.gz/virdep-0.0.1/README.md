# VirDep üß¨

**Identify host dependency factors for viruses using omics data and network biology.**

VirDep is a Python toolkit for bioinformaticians and virologists that enables the discovery of host genes and pathways critical to viral infection and replication. It integrates CRISPR screen data, transcriptomics, and protein interaction networks to prioritize host dependency factors.

## üîç Features

- Analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screen or RNAi data
- Integrate transcriptomic data (bulk or single-cell)
- Network-based prioritization of host factors
- Visualize virus-host interaction maps
- Custom model support (e.g. random forest, logistic regression)
