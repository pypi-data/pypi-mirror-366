   - **Linux:** Most desktop environments display the date in the panel or toolbar.

2. **Using a Smartphone or Tablet:**
   - Check the home screen or the lock screen for the current date.

     print("Today's date is:", today)
     ```

   - **JavaScript:**
     ```javascript
     const today = new Date();
     console.log("Today's date is: " + today.toDateString());
     ```

   - **Java:**
     ```java
     import java.time.LocalDate;
     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
             System.out.println("Today's date is: " + today);
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Using Online Search:**
   - Simply search "current date" on a search engine, and it will typically show the current date at the top of the search results.
