A very simple Python library to get the manufacturer of a specific MAC address

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you want to use this library for one of your projects, you can install it like any other Python library

    print(f"Manufacturer: {manuf}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Online Lookup
