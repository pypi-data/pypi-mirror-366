Dynamical Network Analysis
===========================

This package was built to provide an updated and enhanced Python implementation
of the Dynamical Network Analysis method, for the analysis of Molecular Dynamics
simulations. The package was optimized for interactive data analysis and
visualization through Jupyter Notebooks (see :ref:`Tutorial <Tutorial>`),
and provides an interface for rendering publication-quality figures using
`VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_.
It allows for extensive customization of analysis workflows to suit
research-specific needs.
