A series of tutorials were designed to provide a detailed description of the workflow of
the Dynamical Network Analysis implementation provided here. The tutorials
combine system preparation, data generation, and analysis tools provided in this
package. Tutorials also cover the use if this package through interactive interface
using Jupyter Notebooks, as well as command-line-interface (CLI) scripts that can be
deployed for execution in remote computer clusters.

For the latest version of the tutorial, download the
`tutorial files here <https://gitlab.com/comp-biochem-csu/dynetan_tutorial>`_
along with accompanying
`trajectory data here <https://compbiophysics.auburn.edu/DyNetAn_Tutorial/data/DynamicNetworkAnalysis_MDdata.tar.gz>`_
(trajectory files are approximately 500MB in size).
