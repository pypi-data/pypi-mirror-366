# HarzCoin (v3.2.4)üí∞

HarzCoin is a chill, Python-based decentralized cryptocurrency made for fun, learning, and lowkey flexing. It includes a CLI, desktop GUI (like Bitcoin Core), and even a browser-accessible node interface. You can mine, send, receive, and interact with other HarzCoin nodes over the network.

## ‚öñÔ∏è API (for nerds)

```python
create_wallet()         # returns Wallet object
send(id, key, recipient, amount)  # sends HZC to address
mine(address)           # mines a block
balance(address)        # returns float
add_peer(ip)            # connects node to another peer
```

## üß≥ Packaging Help (if you wanna share)

1. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Build the wheel:

   ```bash
   flit build
   ```
3. Upload to PyPI (if you're a real one):

   ```bash
   flit publish
   ```

If you get a `raise_for_status()` error, check:

* Internet connection
* PyPI creds (`.pypirc`)
* Your token scopes on [https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
