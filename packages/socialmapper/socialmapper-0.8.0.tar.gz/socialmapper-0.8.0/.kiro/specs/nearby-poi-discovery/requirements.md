# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to discover Points of Interest (POIs) within a specified travel time and mode from a given location. Users can input their location (address or coordinates), specify a travel time limit, and choose a travel mode to receive a comprehensive list of nearby POIs with their names, types, and locations. This functionality extends SocialMapper's current capabilities by providing a reverse lookup approach - instead of analyzing accessibility to specific POI types, users can discover all available POIs within their travel constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my location and travel constraints so that I can discover all nearby POIs within my specified travel time and mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a location (address or coordinates) THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the input location
2. WHEN a user specifies a travel time limit THEN the system SHALL accept time values in minutes with reasonable bounds (1-60 minutes)
3. WHEN a user selects a travel mode THEN the system SHALL support walking, biking, and driving modes
4. IF the location cannot be geocoded THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with suggestions for correction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate an isochrone from my location so that I can understand the geographic area within my travel constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid location and travel parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL generate an isochrone polygon representing the reachable area
2. WHEN the isochrone generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages about network connectivity or routing limitations
3. WHEN the travel mode is walking THEN the system SHALL use pedestrian routing networks
4. WHEN the travel mode is biking THEN the system SHALL use bicycle-accessible routing networks
5. WHEN the travel mode is driving THEN the system SHALL use vehicle routing networks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover all POIs within my travel isochrone so that I can see what amenities and services are accessible to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an isochrone is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL query OpenStreetMap for all POIs within the polygon
2. WHEN POIs are found THEN the system SHALL retrieve POI names, types, and exact coordinates
3. WHEN no POIs are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no POIs exist within the specified constraints
4. WHEN POI data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL include available information and mark missing data appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive organized results showing nearby POIs so that I can easily understand what's available in my area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POIs are discovered THEN the system SHALL return results grouped by POI category (schools, restaurants, shops, etc.)
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include POI name, type, address (if available), and coordinates for each result
3. WHEN multiple POIs of the same type exist THEN the system SHALL list all instances with distinguishing information
4. WHEN results are extensive THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics (total count, count by category)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and visualize my nearby POI results so that I can save and share my findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POI discovery is complete THEN the system SHALL offer export options in CSV and GeoJSON formats
2. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL include columns for POI name, type, category, address, latitude, longitude, and distance
3. WHEN exporting to GeoJSON THEN the system SHALL include both the isochrone polygon and POI points as separate features
4. WHEN generating visualizations THEN the system SHALL create an interactive map showing the origin point, isochrone boundary, and discovered POIs with appropriate styling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and customize my POI discovery so that I can focus on specific types of amenities that interest me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying POI discovery THEN the system SHALL allow optional filtering by POI categories (amenity, shop, leisure, etc.)
2. WHEN category filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only return POIs matching the specified categories
3. WHEN no category filters are specified THEN the system SHALL return all discoverable POI types
4. WHEN invalid category filters are provided THEN the system SHALL return an error with valid category options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the nearby POI discovery feature to integrate seamlessly with existing SocialMapper APIs so that it follows established patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use the existing SocialMapperBuilder pattern for configuration
2. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL return results using the established Ok/Err result types
3. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing geocoding, isochrone, and POI query infrastructure
4. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL follow the same error handling and logging patterns as other features
