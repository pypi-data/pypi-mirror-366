# Dingent

> **An Agent Framework for Simplified Data Retrieval Applications**

-----

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Project Under Active Development

**Please Note:** Dingent is currently in its early development stages and has not yet been officially released. We are actively working on the core functionalities and documentation and will announce the first stable version soon.

The current `main` branch contains the latest experimental code and is subject to breaking changes at any time. We strongly advise against using it in a production environment.

Thank you for your understanding and patience\!

## ✨ Introduction

Dingent is a lightweight and user-friendly agent framework focused on simplifying the creation of data retrieval applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to provide a clean and powerful toolkit that enables you to quickly connect data sources (such as APIs, databases, or documents) to an LLM, building intelligent agents capable of question answering, data extraction, and analysis.

## 🚀 Core Features (Planned)

  * **Seamless LLM Integration**: Easily connect with major LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and more.
  * **Declarative Data Sources**: Define your data interfaces with simple configurations, eliminating the need for extensive boilerplate code.
  * **Flexible Agent Construction**: Build upon an extensible Agent class, allowing you to freely compose tools and define custom agent behaviors.
  * **Out-of-the-Box Retrieval Strategies**: Get started quickly with built-in strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to optimize your data retrieval results.

## 💿 Installation (Coming Soon)

Detailed installation instructions will be available with the first official release. You will be able to install the package via pip:

```bash
# Coming soon!
pip install dingent
```

## 📖 Usage Example (Coming Soon)

We are working hard to provide clear documentation and rich code examples to help you get started.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome and appreciate community contributions\! However, until our first official release, we will not be accepting pull requests for new features.

If you have suggestions, bug reports, or ideas you'd like to discuss, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/saya-ashen/Dingent/issues) page.
