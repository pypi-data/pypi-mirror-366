"""Solver CLI for demographically fair machine learning systems.

This module defines the ``solve`` command, which loads one or more system score output
files in JSON format, validates them against a predefined data model, and computes
fairness-related indicators such as accuracy and equalized odds. It outputs JSON files
containing solutions (or operating-modes) following the chosen metrics space, and
thresholds.

Input files must conform to a structured data model including scores, ground-truth
labels, and protected attributes. The CLI provides options to customize metrics, and
select thresholds.
