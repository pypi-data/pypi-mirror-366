    r"""Evaluate the radar-chart area formed by indicators of interest.

    This method calculates the "normalized" area (value between :math:`[0, 1]`) of a
    radar chart formed by indicators listed in ``values``.

    An intuitive way to calculate the area of radar chart is to consider it as a set of
    triangles, defined by the chart axes and the angles between then, out of which you
    know the sizes of two sides, which are given, and the angle between them, which is
    fixed (:math:`2\pi/n`). For example, the area of a 3-way radar chart is therefore
    the total area of 3 triangles with sides equal to each combination of input
    ``values``, with angles of :math:`120^o`.  More generally, the total area can be
    defined as:

    .. math::

       \sum_i^n 0.5 a_i b_i \sin(2\pi/n)

    Where :math:`n` is the total number of axes on the radar chart, and `a_i` and `b_i`
    are the adjacent axes for which we are computing the section area. To normalize this
    such that all charts have a maximum area of 1.0, one must bind the maximum values in
    each of the radar chart axes.  In this implementation, we bind these maxima to 1.0.
    With that, one can compute the largest radar chart area and normalize the given area
    by that value.

    If one considers each triangle individually, it becomes clear that the factor
    :math:`0.5 \sin(2\pi/n)` cancels out and only :math:`a b / max^2` matters.
    This simplified version is implemented here for maximum accuracy and speed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values
        The values of the radar chart plot. Naturally, at least 3 values must be
        provided.  All values are required to lie in the interval :math:`[0, 1]`.
    maximum
        The maximum value one can have in each axis of the radar chart.  This value is
        used to compute the normalization factor.

    Returns
    -------
        The "normalized" area (value between :math:`[0, 1]`) of a
        radar chart formed by indicators listed in ``values``.
