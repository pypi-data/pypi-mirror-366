# Bioreactor-model Python package

## Installation

```bash
pip install bioreactor-model
```

## Functions

`class calc.CellComposition` calculates biomass formula and biomass formula weight
`class calc.CellComposition` solves biomass equation

## Documentation
Available on README.md at [https://github.com/matrixdex/bioreactor-model](https://github.com/matrixdex/bioreactor-model)

## Example
See `tests/test.py` for biomass cell composition calculation from dry weight values, biomass equation solution with gas inlet-outlet transfer values, respiratory quotient determination, and yeast biomass growth solution under glucose and hexane substrates

## Future development

Scale up parameters, fed-batch yield estimation, yield coefficient calculation, gas transfer estimation, oxygen transport and uptake rates will be added soon.
