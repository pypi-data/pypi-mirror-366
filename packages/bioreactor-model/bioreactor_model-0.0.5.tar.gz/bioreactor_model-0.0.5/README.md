# Bioreactor-model Python package

## Installation

```bash
pip install bioreactor-model
```

## Functions

`calc.CellComposition()` calculates biomass formula and biomass formula weight

`calc.BiomassComposition()` solves biomass equation

## Documentation
Read in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matrixdex/bioreactor-model/blob/main/README.md)

## Example

See `tests/test.py` in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matrixdex/bioreactor-model) for biomass cell composition calculation from dry weight values, biomass equation solution with gas inlet-outlet transfer values, respiratory quotient determination, and yeast biomass growth solution under glucose and hexane substrates

## Future development

Scale up parameters, fed-batch yield estimation, yield coefficient calculation, gas transfer estimation, oxygen transport and uptake rates will be added soon.
