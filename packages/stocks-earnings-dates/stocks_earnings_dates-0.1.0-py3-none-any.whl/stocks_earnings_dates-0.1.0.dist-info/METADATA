##  What’s Inside?

This package uses a built-in SQLite database with over **24,000+ earnings dates** collected from public sources, organized by stock ticker.

You can easily:

- Get all historical earnings dates for a given stock.
- List all supported tickers.

##  Usage

```python
from stocks_earnings_dates import get_earnings, list_all_tickers

# Get earnings dates for a specific ticker
dates = get_earnings("AAPL")
print(dates)
# Output: ['2024-08-01', '2024-05-02', ..., '2014-07-22']

# List all tickers available in the database
tickers = list_all_tickers()
print(tickers)
```

## 📁 Data Source

The earnings database was compiled from publicly accessible financial websites.  
The CSV was cleaned, normalized and converted to a bundled SQLite database for fast and offline access.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- This is a static dataset. Updates are not (yet) automated.
- Only dates are available — no earnings surprises or results.

---

## 📬 Future Plans

- Add CLI interface to query from terminal.
- Automatically update the database monthly from trusted sources.
