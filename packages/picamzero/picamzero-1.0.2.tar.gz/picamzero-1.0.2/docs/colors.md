# Colours

When you need to specify a colour, `picamzero` can accept colours in one of three formats:

## RGBA

A tuple containing a colour code in RGB format plus an alpha (transparency) value. For example, red would be:

`(255, 0, 0, 255)`

The first three values are Red, Green and Blue (0-255) and the final value is the transparency, with 0 being fully transparent and 255 being fully opaque.

## Hex colour code

You can specify any valid hex code for a colour, in the format `#000000`.

## Colour name

The following colours can be specified by name as a string:

- `aqua`
- `black`
- `blue`
- `fuchsia`
- `gray`
- `green`
- `lime`
- `maroon`
- `navy`
- `olive`
- `purple`
- `red`
- `silver`
- `teal`
- `white`
- `yellow`
