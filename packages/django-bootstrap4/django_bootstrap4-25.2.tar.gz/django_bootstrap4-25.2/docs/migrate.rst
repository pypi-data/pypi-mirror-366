Migration
=========

Below is a list of warnings when migrating from Bootstrap 3/django-bootstrap3 to Bootstrap 4/django-bootstrap4.

This document only considers the differences between django-bootstrap3 and django-bootstrap4. For the migration
guide from Bootstrap 3 to 4, please look at the Bootstrap docs, especially the `Migration section <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/migration/>`_.

Icons
-----

Bootstrap 4 does not ship with an icon set, so everything regarding icons has been removed.

If you need easy access to icons that are compatible with Bootstrap 4, please consider using `django-icons <https://github.com/zostera/django-icons>`_.
