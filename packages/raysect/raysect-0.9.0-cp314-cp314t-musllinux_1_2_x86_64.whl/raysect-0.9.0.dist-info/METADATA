Raysect Python Raytracing Package
=================================

A ray-tracing framework for optical/non-optical physics simulations.

The aims of the Raysect project are as follows:

* develop a ray-tracer that is easy for scientists and engineers to use and extend

* the raytracer must be robust and high precision

The general development philosophy is ease of use trumps performance, but performance is not to be ignored.

For more information, see the [documentation pages](http://www.raysect.org/).

Please note, this code is currently under heavy development and subject to change.

Raysect currently only supports Linux. Windows support will come at a later stage.

Please note, for legal reasons we require the copyright to any contributed code to be passed to the Raysect project. Please see CONTRIBUTING.txt in the repository.
