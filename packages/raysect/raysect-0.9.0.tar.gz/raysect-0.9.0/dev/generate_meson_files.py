    Generates the meson.build files for the project from a set of template files.

    A root build.meson will be placed in the project root and meson.build files will be generated for the specified
    package folders. This script must be executed from the root folder of the project.

    If substantive changes are needed to the meson.build files throughout the project, it will be easier to modify the
    templates and trigger the regeneration process.

    This script will remove any existing meson.build files, so be sure any changes are captured before re-running this
    script. There are two template files:

        * root-meson.build
        * subdir-meson.build

    The root-meson.build file is used to generate the root meson.build for the project. The subdir-meson.build is used
    to generate the meson.build files in the project sub-directory. The templates are read and handled as a python
    f-strings. See the script implementation for the variables available to the template. The meson.build files will
    consist of the template followed by a set of subdir() entries for each descendant of the current sub-directory
    (if not excluded).

    A sub-directory may be excluded from the generation process by placing a file in the subfolder called
    ".meson-exclude". If the exclusion file is found, the sub-directory and its descendants will be ignored during
    the generation process.

    Occasionally a meson.build file may need to be customised in the source tree. Placing a file called ".meson-custom"
    in the same directory as the meson.build file will protect the customised file from deletion or replacement by this
    script.
