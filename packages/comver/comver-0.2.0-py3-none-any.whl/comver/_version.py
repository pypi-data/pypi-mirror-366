"""Versioning related core functionality of `comver`.

This module is responsible for heavy-lifting with respect to:

- version calculations based on multiple factors (from `string`s,
    `git` commits etc.)
- filtering based on user/config provided info (e.g. exclusion of
    specific committer name)

Usually `Version.from_git_configured()` is an entrypoint one
should be interested in.

Important:
    Check out guidelines and tutorials for information about CLI/plugin
    usage and suggested configuration. This section should be of interest
    to people wanting to use the API directly (e.g. new integrations).

        Important:
            This `classmethod`'s arguments, if not provided, will be

            (see [loadfig](https://github.com/open-nudge/loadfig)
            for more information)

        Example configuration (`pyproject.toml` in your project's git root):

        ```toml
        [tool.comver]
        # All commits will be included EXCEPT the ones with matching scopes
        # e.g. ("feat: add versioning [no version]")
        # Note: These are raw strings
        message_excludes = [
            ".*\[no version\].*",
            ".*\[skip version\].*",
            ".*\[version skip\].*",
        ]
        # Only changes to the src/* folder count or `pyproject.toml`
        # For version calculations

        author_name_excludes = [
            "github-actions[bot]",
        ]
        ```

        Example usage:

        ```python
        import comver

        # Every value taken from the configuration (if available)
        for output in comver.Version.git_configured():
            print(output.commit.hexsha, output.version)
        ```

        Commit messages are used to calculate versions based on the
        regexes (`major_regexes`, `minor_regexes` and `patch_regexes`).

        Tip:
            You can also configure this function via `.comver.toml`
            instead of `pyproject.toml`, in such case
            remove the `[tool.comver]` header, rest stays the same.

        Warning:
            `*_exclude` regexes take precedence over `*_include` regexes,
            the `*_include` regexes are checked first, then the `*_exclude`
            regexes might disinclude the `*_include` match

        Warning:
            `author_name`, `author_email` and `path` exclusions
            __will exclude them from output__ (unlike message based
            filtering). If the commit does not match it will not be yielded.

        Warning:
            Message based filtering will not change the version
            (the same will be returned),
            __but the Version-Commit pair will be returned__.
