"""Extensions and plugins integrating `comver` with third party systems.

Most of the extensions are tailored to the Python ecosystem, and its
packagae managers specifically.

__Currently supported third party tools:__

- [`pdm`](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) package manager.
- [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/plugins/version-source/reference/)
    package manager.

Warning:
    Check out guidelines and tutorials for information about CLI/plugin
    usage and suggested configuration. This section should be of interest
    to people wanting to use the API directly (e.g. new integrations).
