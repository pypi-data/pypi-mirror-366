"""comver internal API reference.

This section of documentation should be mainly considered by people who:

- are curious how the project works under the hood
- want to provide integration of `comver` with third part tooling.

Important:
    Check out guidelines and tutorials for information about CLI/plugin
    as this is a more common starting point.
