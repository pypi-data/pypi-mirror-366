        color gradient. The heatmap helps identify areas of high and low trajectory activity.

            df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing trajectory data with a 'geometry'

            area (gpd.GeoDataFrame): A GeoDataFrame defining the geographical area to be 
                analyzed. Used to determine grid boundaries and overlay the area outline 
                on the plot.
            ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): The matplotlib axes object on which to draw the 
                heatmap. Allows integration with existing figure layouts.
            cell_size (int): The side length of each grid cell in meters. Determines the 
                spatial resolution of the heatmap - smaller values create finer grids
