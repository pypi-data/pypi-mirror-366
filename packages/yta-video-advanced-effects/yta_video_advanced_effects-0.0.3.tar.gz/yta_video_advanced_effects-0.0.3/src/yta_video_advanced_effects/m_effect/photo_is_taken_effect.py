    Simulates that a photo is taken by making a white blink and
    a camera click sound. This effect doesn't freeze the video,
    it is just a white blink with a camera photo sound being
    played.

    This effect doesn't stop or freezes the video so it doesn't
    affect to its duration.

    What to do with the result? **REPLACE**

    The result should be replacing the original clip in the 
    affected part as it is still being reproduced while the
    effect is applied.
