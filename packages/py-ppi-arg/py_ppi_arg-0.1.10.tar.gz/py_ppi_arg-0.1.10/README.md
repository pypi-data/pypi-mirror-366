## Features

#### Available Methods

#### Initialization

Before using the library, you need to initialize it with a valid email and password.

#### REST

The library provides functions to make requests to the REST API and retrieve the corresponding responses.

###### Functions

* **get_tickers_list**: Retrieves instruments quote list information filtered by instrument type, operation type and settlement.
* **search_tickers** : Queries the API to search for a particular instrument based on the name.
* **get_technical_data_bonds**: Retrieves the techical data for a bond.
* **get_historic_data**: Retrieves the historic data for an item.
* **get_intraday_data**: Retrieves the intraday data for an item.

> All functions return a dictionary representing the JSON response.

#### Enumerations

The library also provides enumerations to help developers avoid errors and improve readability.

* **Currency** : Identifies the available currencies in the app.
* **InstrumentTypes** : Identifies the instrument types.
* **OperationType**: Identifies the operation types.
* **Settlements** : Identifies the different settlement dates.

## Usage

Once the library has been installed, you can import and initialize it. The initialization sets the email and password. It then attempts to authenticate with the provided credentials. If the authentication fails, an `ApiException` is thrown.

```
from py_ppi_arg import PPI

app = PPI(email="sample@email.com", password="S4mp13.p4ssW0rd")
```

#### REST

```
# Get information about all the available bonds
app.get_tickers_list(
    instrument_type = app.instrument_types.PUBLIC_BOND,
    operation_type = app.operation_types.COMPRA,
    settlement = app.settlements.T2
)

# Get the technical data for a bond
app.get_technical_data_bonds(
        settlement=app.settlements.T2,
        item_id="804421"
        )

# Get the historic price data for an instrument
app.get_historic_data(item_id="261", settlement=app.settlements.T2)

# Get the information about for an instrument
app.search_tickers(short_ticker = "AL30")

```
