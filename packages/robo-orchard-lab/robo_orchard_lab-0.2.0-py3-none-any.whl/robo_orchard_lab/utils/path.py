    """Context manager to temporarily change the current working directory.

    This provides a safe way to perform operations within a specific directory.
    It changes the directory to the given path upon entering the 'with'
    block and guarantees that the original directory is restored upon exiting,
    even if an exception occurs.

    Args:
        destination (str): The path of the directory to change into.

    Yields:
        str: The changed directory

    Example:
        >>> import os
        >>> if not os.path.exists("my_temp_dir"):
        ...     os.makedirs("my_temp_dir")
        >>> original_dir = os.getcwd()
        >>> print(f"Starting in: {original_dir}")
        Starting in: /path/to/current
        >>> with in_cwd("my_temp_dir"):
        ...     print(f"Inside 'with' block: {os.getcwd()}")
        Inside 'with' block: /path/to/current/my_temp_dir
        >>> print(f"Back in: {os.getcwd()}")
        Back in: /path/to/current
