When that region too was overrun by Blood forces the issue became irrelevant, but by then the maps had been finalized. The region was given its current name (a reference to an obscure piece of scripture) relatively recently, and while its original designation is no longer present anywhere in official records, part of it has been adopted by the region's hardy capsuleer residents who keep alive what they see as the old traditions.",
