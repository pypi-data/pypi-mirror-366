# strainedSMILES2xyz

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/strainedsmiles2xyz)](https://pypi.org/project/strainedsmiles2xyz/)

**strainedSMILES2xyz** is a Python tool that uses RDKit and ORCA to generate 3D `.xyz` geometries from SMILES strings — specifically designed for *strained molecules*.
It provides a simple interface for both scripting and command-line use.

📄 *Note: A publication describing the method is in preparation. Link will be added here once available.*

---

## 📦 Installation

Install via pip (requires Python 3.8+):

```bash
pip install strainedsmiles2xyz
```

⚠️ RDKit must be installed separately via conda or similar:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit=2025.03.1
```

You will also need [ORCA](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/) version 6.0 or higher in your `PATH` or set as `ORCA_PATH` to enable ORCA based corrections.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 From the command line:

```bash
python -m strainedsmiles2xyz "SMILES"
```

or:

```bash
strainedsmiles2xyz "SMILES"
```

This prints an XYZ-formatted structure to `stdout`.

---

### 🐍 From Python:

```python
from strainedsmiles2xyz import smiles_to_xyz

mol, info = smiles_to_xyz(
    "C1=CCC1",                     # SMILES input
    print_level=1,                # log verbosity
    no_chirality_enforced_allowed=True,  # allow fallback if stereochemistry fails
    use_orca_corrections=False,  #  apply ORCA optimization corrections
    n_cores=1                     # number of threads for ORCA
)
```

* `mol` is an RDKit `Mol` object
* `info` is a dictionary containing metadata and the `"xyz_string"` (raw XYZ output)

---

## 📁 Included Data

* `notebooks/`: Notebooks demonstrating the inner workings of the method, including how RDKit, Open Babel, and strainedSMILES2xyz perform in different cases
* `benchmark/`: Benchmarking results — XYZ files generated by different methods and re-optimized using GFN2-xTB

---

## ⚙ Requirements

* **RDKit** ≥ 2025.03.0
  *(Must be installed via Conda or other method — not available via PyPI)*
* **ORCA** ≥ 6.0 (strongly recommended; used for correction step)

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
strainedsmiles2xyz "C1=CCC1" > cyclobutene.xyz
```
