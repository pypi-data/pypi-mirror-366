# üèÜ RAG Evaluation Suite

A comprehensive, asynchronous, and framework-agnostic library for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

This tool provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for RAG evaluation‚Äîfrom automatically synthesizing a high-quality test set from your own documents to running a suite of sophisticated, AI-powered diagnostic metrics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comprehensive "RAG Triad" Metrics:** Evaluate **Context Relevance**, **Faithfulness**, and **Answer Relevance**.
- **Advanced Diagnostics:** Includes **Answer Completeness** to pinpoint why an answer is strong or weak.
- **Automated Test Case Generation:** Use the built-in **Data Synthesizer** to create test cases from any document.
- **High-Performance Async Pipeline:** Powered by `asyncio` for fast, parallel execution.
- **Framework-Agnostic:** Works with any RAG system‚ÄîLangChain, LlamaIndex, or plain Python.
- **Flexible Judge Model:** Supports GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, or local models (e.g., via Ollama).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install rag-eval-suite
```


### 2. Run Your First Evaluation
Create a Python script using the RAGEvaluator:

```bash
import asyncio
from rag_eval_suite import RAGEvaluator
from rag_eval_suite.data_models import TestCase, RAGResult

# 1. Instantiate the evaluator (uses local Ollama model by default)
evaluator = RAGEvaluator(judge_model="ollama/llama3")

# 2. Define test case and RAG system output
test_case = TestCase(
    question="What are the notable features of the stadium's pitch and roof?",
    ground_truth_context=["The stadium features a fully retractable roof... and a hybrid pitch..."],
    ground_truth_answer="The stadium has a fully retractable roof and a hybrid pitch."
)

rag_result = RAGResult(
    retrieved_context=["The stadium features a fully retractable roof... and a hybrid pitch..."],
    final_answer="The stadium has a fully retractable roof."  # Intentionally incomplete
)

# 3. Run the evaluation
async def main():
    evaluation_result = await evaluator.aevaluate(test_case, rag_result)
    print(evaluation_result.scores)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### üîß Configuration
To use other models (e.g., OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o), configure via environment variables:

```
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

evaluator = RAGEvaluator(judge_model="gpt-4o")
```
