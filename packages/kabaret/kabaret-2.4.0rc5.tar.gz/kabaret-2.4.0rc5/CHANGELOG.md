## [2.4.0rc3] - 2025-08-1

### Changed

* Hide actions according to their ui hidden status

## [2.4.0rc4] - 2025-07-30

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Pyside2 can no longer be used, version 6 is now the minimum requirement.

### Added

* You can now use `KabaretSession` command line arguments from environment variables.
    * Priority is still given to arguments.
    * `--session`: `KABARET_SESSION`
    * `--host`: `KABARET_REDIS_HOST`
    * `--port`: `KABARET_REDIS_PORT`
    * `--cluster`: `KABARET_REDIS_CLUSTER`
    * `--db`: `KABARET_REDIS_DB`
    * `--password`: `KABARET_REDIS_PASSWORD`
    * `--read_replica_host`: `KABARET_READ_REPLICA_HOST`
    * `--read_replica_port`: `KABARET_READ_REPLICA_PORT`
    * `--debug`: `KABARET_DEBUG`

### Changed

* `FlowView` focus tracking has been drastically improved.
    * The dock title bar now indicates whether the view is currently in focus.
    * Many scenarios now handle updating the focus. Such as from child widgets, dock actions or goto oid.

### Fixed

* Remove any invalid layout presets that could cause a `KabaretStandaloneGUISession` not to show up at launch.

## [2.4.0rc3] - 2024-09-06

### Fixed

issue #130 - Redis connection error raised by the `Cluster.connect_from_env()` command when the replica port exists in the environment as an empty string (as set by the `Cluster.connect()` command).

## [2.4.0rc2] - 2024-06-21

### Fixed

* Support of redis replica for showcase session.

### Removed

* Register the `kabaret.script_view` view type on showcase session, as this is now done automatically in version 1.2.0 of the plugin. If you have manually registered on your session, you should remove it. This will avoid problems caused by a double plugin registration.

## [2.4.0rc1] - 2024-06-20

### Added

issue #123 - A read replica of a redis cluster can now be used to reduce latency. You need to specify the host and port of the replica with the `--read_replica_host` and `--read_replica_port` command line arguments. The environnement variables `KABARET_READ_REPLICA_HOST` and `KABARET_READ_REPLICA_PORT` can be used for command line sessions.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-06-20

### ! Python version support breaking change !

From this version, **only python 3.7 and up is supported !**

### Added

issue #94 - New ui options `dialog_size`, `dialog_min_size` and `dialog_max_size` to respectively set the default, minimum and maximum sizes (in pixels) of an action dialog window. If `dialog_size` is not provided, the window is resized according to its content and the size limits when provided.

issue #104 - The type of the manager of all instances of an `Object` subclass can be redefined with the class attribute `_MANAGER_TYPE`. The class attribute `_PROPAGATE_MANAGER_TYPE` can also be used to control the propagation of the manager type in the sub-tree objects: a boolean value indicates if the manager type of the object must be propagated, while a `None` value is equivalent to using the value set in the parent class. Eventually, any relation of an object can now be retrieved through the manager's `get_relation` method.

issue #120 - New `path` editor which allows to select one or more file paths through the file explorer.

issue #121 - New `image` editor which allows to load an image to the base64 format and display it. The image can be selected through the file explorer or dragged and dropped.

issue #117 - The `KabaretStandaloneGUISession` session now keeps track of the `FlowView` currently focused, which can be retrieved using the session's `current_view()` method. Whenever the current view changes, a `focus_changed` event is dispatched with the ID of the new current view.

issue #122 - Layout preset tools on the `SessionToolBar` view have been improved to handle additional view state data such as size, position, navigation history and also window geometry.
For now, presets are stored locally in `.json` files on the user session and structured by cluster. You can specify a different folder path with `--layout-savepath` command line argument.
The upcoming 'Users' actor will extend storage possibilities, such as store presets in the redis database.
Activation of layout tools is done on the `KabaretStandaloneGUISession` session and new command line arguments are here for easy disabling if needed.
A session layout autosave feature can be enabled, making backups of the last five sessions in their most recent state.

issue #127 - Documentation for `sort_order` option for maps in showcase `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.maps`.

issue #128 - Main window can be resized to a specific width and height with `resize` function in the main window manager.

### Changed

issue #112 - Versioneer is now used for versioning control system. You can access kabaret version using : `import kabaret; print(kabaret.__version__)`. Versioneer will be more usefull for releases.

issue #118 - Logging has been improved for more readability. Disable `logging.propagate` to avoid double messages in custom project flows. Remove ICCP chunk on `.png` files to clear a libpng error.

### Fixed

Remove a stretch in layout when using Custom Page. Caused problems for resizing and fully expanding the page size.

issue #124 - `FlowPage` of a `FlowDialogView` is now updated once on init.

issue #125 - Parse ui options for action parent to a map.

issue #126 - An action dialog now appears from the center of the main window, regardless its size.

issue #129 - Layout tools command line arguments are now on the `KabaretStandaloneGUISession` session. A non-GUI session is no longer affected by this feature.

Widgets from a custom page or `FlowLayout` should now be properly deleted and avoid ghosting and UI flickering behaviour.

## [2.2.0] - 2023-02-01

### ! Python version support !

2.2 is the last version of Kabaret supporting Python 2. Incoming versions starting from 2.3 will exclusively support Python 3.

### ! Breaking changes !

The return value of the `session.cmds.Flow.ls()` command has changed to also include the related oid. This is needed by the
introduction of the new `Relative` relation with which you can no longer assume that a related object's id is
`<relation_owner_id>/<related_name>`. 

If you were using `ls` in automation scripts, you will need to update its returned value unpacking.

Previous return value:
`(relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`

New return value:
`(related_oid, relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`

### Added

issue #88 - Mapped items "background_color" does show in GUI.

issue #99 & #100 - New plugin system to allow code-less intallation of third party extensions. See new "Plugin"
section of the documentation: https://kabaret.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_system.html

PePy download badge in README

issue #79 - New Flow command `session.cmds.Flow.set_home_oid(my_oid)` to configure the "Home" action.

issue #83 - New ui option `navigation_bar`. If set to `False`, the flow page will hide the navigation bar.
See example usages in showcase `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.ui_config`. 
Also added an entry in the FlowView "Options" menu to toggle the navigation bar visible/hidden.

issue #78 - View titles can be formated by using a `view_id` like `<formater>|<view_id>` where formater
is used like `formater.format(some_title)`. This particularly interesting to control the title of views 
created by using `goto_target` in the return value of a `flow.Action.run()`.

issue #71 - Action menus for Relation and Map items can contain sub-menus based on the Action group. 
Use `relation.ui(action_submenus=True)` and/or `relation.ui(items_action_submenus=True)`.

issue #60 - Any session created is accessible with `kabaret.app.get_session(my_session_uid)`. You can
get the last created one with `kabaret.app.get_session()`.

issue #73 - `choice` editor support arbitrary icon for each choice using the `choice_icons` option.

issue #11 - `textarea` editor now correctly shows when edited and is correctly auto-applied in action dialogs.
A 'Cancel' button was added to revert to the last loaded value. The 'Apply' and 'Cancel' buttons are now hidden
until an edit is made. A new option `buttons_side` was added to specify the buttons side.

issue #31 - Added the ability to access other projects in the flow with `self.root().project('OtherProjectName')`

issue #74 - Added `injectable()` method on `Child` relations (and sub relations) which let developer inject their Object types inside someone else flow using the `kabaret.flow.injection` module. See the documentation at https://kabaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/injection.html for details.

issue #70 - Customizable double click behaviour on `Map` items. See usage and example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.maps.map_actions`, and here: https://gitlab.com/kabaretstudio/kabaret/-/issues/70#note_409303471

issue #66 - Added a new relation `Relative` which gives access to any Object in the flow given an `oid` relative to its parent. See usage and code example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.relations`.

issue #68 - Added `kabaret.flow.Connection.allow_cross_project()` to allow Connection / Ref to
an object inside another project.

This has been a long request, especially to have dynamic value for the `icon` and `hidden` properties.

issue #48 - Custom UI Page

It is now possible to provide an arbitrary widget to display/edit an Object in the Flow view.

This can be specified at the relation's level with `Relation(...).ui(custom_page='my_module.MyWidget')`.
Or at the Object level by overridding `Object._fill_ui(ui)`.

See `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.UnittestProject` "Custom Page" for details and example.
