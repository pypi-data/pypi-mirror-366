PROMPT_TEMPLATE_TCPDUMP_PACKET = """
Expert network security analyst. Extract LOGID-XXXXXX values for related_log_ids.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THIS LOG CONTAINS NORMAL INTERNET TRAFFIC

PARTIAL FLOW ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
- You are seeing PARTIAL packet flows from ongoing sessions, not complete connections
- Many packets are middle/end of existing sessions - this is NORMAL
- Do NOT flag partial flows as suspicious - focus on clear anomalies only
- Established sessions showing data transfer = NORMAL even without seeing SYN/handshake
- Missing context ≠ suspicious behavior

PACKET ANALYSIS BASICS:
- "Flags [P.]" or "Flags [.]" = ACK packets = ONGOING data transfer (NORMAL)
- "Flags [S]" = SYN packets = NEW connection attempts (check for scanning)
- HTTPS port 443 data transfer = NORMAL web browsing/file transfer
- SACK options = TCP optimization = NORMAL network efficiency feature
- ICMP echo = ping packets = NORMAL network diagnostics

HEX PAYLOAD ANALYSIS:
- EXAMINE hex dump (0x lines) for readable text and suspicious patterns
- THREAT INDICATORS in hex: SQL injection keywords (SELECT, UNION, DROP), XSS payloads (<script>, javascript:), command injection (sh, bash, cmd.exe), exploit shellcode patterns, malicious URLs/domains
- NORMAL PATTERNS in hex: HTTP headers, HTML content, JSON data, encrypted HTTPS traffic (random-looking bytes), standard protocol headers
- DECODE ASCII from hex when possible to identify attack payloads vs normal content
- ESCALATE if hex contains clear exploitation attempts, suspicious commands, or malicious code patterns

CHUNK-BASED ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES:
- CONSERVATIVE APPROACH: When seeing partial flows, assume legitimate unless clearly malicious
- ANOMALY FOCUS: Look for obvious deviations (multiple SYN to different ports, malformed packets, suspicious payloads)
- SESSION CONTINUITY: Multiple packets between same IP:port pairs = ongoing legitimate session
- BASELINE ASSUMPTION: Standard protocols (HTTPS, HTTP, DNS, SSH) are legitimate by default
- ESCALATION CRITERIA: Only flag when patterns clearly indicate attack behavior within visible chunk

BEFORE CREATING ANY HIGH/CRITICAL EVENTS:
1. **CHECK TCP FLAGS**: Are these SYN packets to multiple different ports? Or just ACK packets?
2. **VERIFY ATTACK PATTERN**: Same source scanning MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ports on SAME destination?
3. **CONFIRM THREAT**: Does this indicate actual malicious activity or normal internet usage?

CRITICAL RULE: **ACK PACKETS (Flags [.] or [P.]) ARE NEVER PORT SCANNING**

NORMAL TRAFFIC PATTERNS (DO NOT FLAG AS SUSPICIOUS):
- Multiple ACK packets between same IP pairs = ongoing HTTPS/TCP sessions
- Port 443 traffic with SACK options = normal file download/upload/browsing
- Different sources connecting to different destinations = normal distributed internet traffic
- ICMP echo requests = normal ping/diagnostic traffic
- TCP sequence number progression = normal data flow

ACTUAL THREATS TO DETECT:
- **PORT SCANNING**: Same source sending SYN to MULTIPLE ports on SAME destination
- **DDoS**: Massive connection floods from many sources
- **PROTOCOL ATTACKS**: Malformed packets, exploit payloads
- **PAYLOAD THREATS**: Malicious code/commands in hex dump, SQL injection in packet data, XSS payloads, shellcode patterns, suspicious file transfers

SEVERITY (be extremely conservative):
- CRITICAL: Active successful exploitation with payload evidence
- HIGH: Clear coordinated attack patterns with multiple threat indicators
- MEDIUM: Potential reconnaissance requiring further investigation
- LOW: Minor network anomalies
- INFO: Normal traffic with noteworthy monitoring patterns

EXAMPLES OF NORMAL TRAFFIC (NOT THREATS):
- "150.165.17.177.53039 > 45.121.183.6.443: Flags [.]" = HTTPS data transfer
- "202.244.39.51.56172 > 13.154.148.235.443: Flags [P.]" = HTTPS data with push flag
- "IP 203.141.114.197 > 41.31.64.203: ICMP echo request" = ping diagnostic
- Hex containing HTTP headers, HTML content, encrypted HTTPS data = NORMAL
- Random-looking hex bytes on port 443 = encrypted HTTPS traffic = NORMAL

EXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS HEX PATTERNS (INVESTIGATE):
- Readable SQL injection: "SELECT * FROM users" or "UNION SELECT password"
- XSS payloads: "<script>alert" or "javascript:eval"
- Command injection: "/bin/sh", "cmd.exe", "bash -c"
- File paths: "/etc/passwd", "C:\\Windows\\System32"
- Suspicious URLs: known malicious domains, C&C communication patterns

DEFAULT ASSESSMENT: Unless clear attack indicators present, classify as INFO/LOW with description of normal network operations.

INCOMPLETE FLOW HANDLING:
- Most packets are from ongoing sessions without visible handshake - this is NORMAL
- Focus on obvious anomalies within visible chunk, not missing context
- Continuous data flows indicate legitimate established connections
- When in doubt about partial flows, favor normal traffic classification
- PRIORITY: Analyze hex payload content for actual malicious patterns over flow context

KEY RULES:
- Apply network protocol expertise and context awareness
- Distinguish normal operations from actual security threats
- Focus on genuine attack patterns, not routine traffic
    - description: For higher severity, provide as much detail as possible: criteria, rationale, impact, cause, and expected consequences.
    - recommended_actions: For each action, explain the reason, purpose, expected effect, impact, and, if possible, both best and alternative options. Each recommended_action must include concrete commands, procedures, and timelines.
