GEO_GUIDELINES: str = \
"""Guidelines for Preprocessing Gene Expression Data from GEO Series:

Gene expression datasets from GEO often require careful preprocessing to ensure reliable downstream analysis. This 
pipeline standardizes the preprocessing steps while maintaining data quality and biological relevance.

1. Initial Data Acquisition and Organization
   GEO series typically contain two key files: a SOFT file with detailed annotations and a matrix file with expression 
   values.
   - Identify and locate both files in the dataset
   - Extract essential metadata including series description and clinical annotations
   - Observe sample characteristics to understand the dataset's demographic and clinical composition

2. Clinical Feature Assessment
   Human studies require careful consideration of both the trait of interest and potential confounding factors.
   - Examine if the dataset contains gene expression measurements (not solely miRNA or methylation data)
   - Assess availability of the target trait in clinical annotations
   - Identify age and gender information, which are important covariates that often confound gene expression
   - Convert clinical variables to appropriate data types:
     * Binary traits should be coded as 0/1 with consistent rules (e.g., control=0, case=1)
     * Continuous traits should be converted to numerical values
   - Extract and standardize clinical features when trait data is present

3. Gene Expression Matrix Processing
   Microarray and RNA-seq data often come with different types of gene identifiers, requiring careful handling.
   - Extract the gene expression matrix while preserving sample identifiers
   - Observe the format of gene identifiers (e.g., gene symbols, probe IDs, RefSeq)

4. Gene Identifier Review
   Modern analyses require standardized gene symbols, but many datasets use platform-specific identifiers.
   - Analyze whether the expression data uses standardized human gene symbols
   - If non-standard identifiers are used, which means gene mapping is needed, then proceed with gene annotation and 
     mapping steps; otherwise, jump directly to data integration

5. Gene Annotation Extraction
   When mapping is needed, we extract probe-gene relationships from the platform annotation.
   - Extract the mapping information from the SOFT file
   - Identify the appropriate columns containing probe IDs and corresponding gene symbols
   - Observe the annotation data to verify its completeness and quality.

6. Gene Symbol Mapping
   The relationship between probes and genes is often many-to-many, requiring careful handling:
   - For one probe mapping to multiple genes:
     * Split the probe's expression value equally among all target genes
     * This maintains the total expression signal while avoiding bias
   - For multiple probes mapping to one gene:
     * Sum the contributions from all probes
     * This captures the total expression while accounting for split values
   - Example: If probe P1 maps to genes G1 and G2, and probe P2 maps to G2:
     * G1 receives 0.5 × P1
     * G2 receives (0.5 × P1) + P2

7. Data Integration and Quality Control
   The final step ensures data quality while maximizing usable samples and features.
   - Normalize gene symbols to ensure consistency across the dataset
   - Integrate clinical and genetic data, ensuring proper sample alignment
   - Apply systematic missing value handling:
     * Remove samples lacking trait information as they cannot contribute to analysis
     * Remove genes with excessive missing values (>20%) to maintain data reliability
     * Filter out samples with too many missing gene measurements (>5%)
     * Carefully impute remaining missing values: use mode imputation for gender and mean for other features.
   - Evaluate potential biases in trait and demographic features
   - Proceed with saving the processed dataset only if it passes quality checks

GEO_FEATURE_ANALYSIS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT: str = \
"""
As a biomedical research team, we are analyzing datasets to study the association between the human trait and genetic 
factors, considering the possible influence of age and gender. (The trait is defined above in Setups and assigned to the
Python variable `trait`.) After searching the GEO database and parsing the matrix file of a series, we have obtained
background information and sample characteristics data. Please review the output from a previous step and answer the 
following questions regarding this dataset:

1. Gene Expression Data Availability
   - Is this dataset likely to contain gene expression data? (Note: Pure miRNA data or methylation data are not 
     suitable.)
     - If YES, set `is_gene_available` to `True`. Otherwise set it to `False`.

2. Variable Availability and Data Type Conversion
   For each of the variables `trait`, 'age', and 'gender', address the following points:

   **2.1 Data Availability**
     - If human data for this variable is available, identify the key in the sample characteristics dictionary where 
       unique values of this variable are recorded. The key is an integer. The variable data might be explicitly 
       recorded or can be inferred from the field with biomedical knowledge or understanding of the dataset background. 
       If you can't find such a key, this means the data is not available. 
     - Constant features are useless in our associative studies. Therefore, if there is only one unique value under the
       key in the sample characteristics dictionary, or if the background information suggests that "everyone has the 
       same value for some variable", consider it as not available.
     - Name the keys `trait_row`, `age_row`, and `gender_row`, respectively. Use None to indicate the corresponding data
       is not available.

   **2.2 Data Type Conversion**
     - Choose an appropriate data type for each variable ('continuous' or 'binary').
     - If the data type is binary, convert values to 0 and 1. For gender data, convert female to 0 and male to 1.
     - Write a Python function to convert any given value of the variable to this data type. Typically, a colon (':') 
       separates the header and the value in each cell, so ensure to extract the value after the colon in the function. 
       Unknown values should be converted to None.
     - When data is not explicitly given but can be inferred, carefully observe the unique values in the sample 
       characteristics dictionary, think about what they mean in this dataset, and design a heuristic rule to convert 
       those values into the chosen type. If you are 90% sure that some cases should be mapped to a known value, please 
       do that instead of giving `None`. 
     - Name the functions `convert_trait`, `convert_age`, and `convert_gender`, respectively.

3. Save Metadata
   Please conduct initial filtering on the usability of the dataset and save relevant information using the 
   `validate_and_save_cohort_info` function from the library. Trait data availability can be determined by whether 
   `trait_row` is None.

4. Clinical Feature Extraction
   If trait_row is not None, it means clinical data is available, then you MUST DO this substep. Otherwise, you should 
   skip this substep.
   Use the `geo_select_clinical_features` function to extract clinical features from the input dataframe `clinical_data`
   that we previously obtained, observe the output dataframe with the `preview_df` function, and save it as a CSV file 
   to `out_clinical_data_file`.
