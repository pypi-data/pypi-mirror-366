# Getting Started with Lob API

## Introduction

Lob helps creators extend their applications into the physical world with automated direct mail and address verification APIs.

**Get started in the way that works best for you:**

- Watch our 10-minute video walkthrough showing how to get started with Lob API collections.

<video src="https://youtube.com/embed/JDrxdzqghuQ" width="340"></video>

- Explore our API documentatation: [docs.lob.com](https://docs.lob.com)

- Read through our Getting Started guide below

**Getting Started**

[Sign up for a free Lob account](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register)

Your API keys are located under [Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account).

You'll use the **SECRET API KEYS** that begin with test_. for your Test API key and live_. for your Live API key.

In order to use the collections in this public workspace, you'll select the Lob API collection and fork it into your personal workspace.

You'll also want to setup environment variables. A short cut is to fork Lob Public Env from Lob's public workspace. You also have the option to create them yourself - see the image below.

Set the **Current Value** for LIVE_API_KEY and TEST_API_KEY to your Lob "live" and "test" API keys and click **Save**.

Make sure **Lob Public Env** is selected in the environment menu.

Start exploring Lob's API collection

_The Test API key is used for all print & mail related endpoints while the Live API key is used for the address verification endpoint._

## Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `3.7+`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install lob-api-sdk==1.0.0
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lob-api-sdk/1.0.0

## Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `pytest` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands

```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](https://www.github.com/MuHamza30/lob-api-python-sdk/tree/1.0.0/doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| environment | `Environment` | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.PRODUCTION`** |
| http_client_instance | `HttpClient` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| override_http_client_configuration | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| http_call_back | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| timeout | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| max_retries | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| backoff_factor | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| retry_statuses | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| retry_methods | `Array of string` | The http methods on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: ['GET', 'PUT']** |
| basic_auth_credentials | [`BasicAuthCredentials`](https://www.github.com/MuHamza30/lob-api-python-sdk/tree/1.0.0/doc/auth/basic-authentication.md) | The credential object for Basic Authentication |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
from lobapi.configuration import Environment
from lobapi.http.auth.basic_auth import BasicAuthCredentials
from lobapi.lobapi_client import LobapiClient

client = LobapiClient(
    basic_auth_credentials=BasicAuthCredentials(
        username='username',
        password='password'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Authorization

This API uses the following authentication schemes.

* [`basic (Basic Authentication)`](https://www.github.com/MuHamza30/lob-api-python-sdk/tree/1.0.0/doc/auth/basic-authentication.md)
