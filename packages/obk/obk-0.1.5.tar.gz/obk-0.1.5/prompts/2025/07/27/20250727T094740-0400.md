<!--
This is a self-contained prompt and spec for OBK/Codex agent work.
- Inputs, outputs, workflows, and tests are listed below.
- All document rules and agent policies are defined in the "Document Specification" section.
- Agents may only update workflows and add new tests (see rules).
- Everything else is for maintainers to edit as needed.
- This file should be easy to read and quick to update—no hidden steps or dependencies.

## 1. Purpose

Set up the repository for the `obk` CLI project. </gsl-purpose>

<gsl-inputs>

## 2. Inputs

This table lists key artifacts—tools, articles, or other sources—that directly guide or constrain the OBK scaffold.

</gsl-inputs>
<gsl-outputs>

## 3. Outputs

This section lists the main components produced by the OBK scaffold.

* Code automation workflows
* Gritlabs Preamble templates
* XML-based workflows
* Git stacked branching workflow (best practices)
* Repo with branch protections
* Versioning and changelog automation

</gsl-outputs>
<gsl-workflows>

## 4. Workflows

This section lists the main steps or processes required to set up the project.

* Familiarize yourself with the Gritlabs Preamble scaffold and add it to the repo
* Read articles listed in Inputs
* Set up the repo based on these articles
* Pushes to the `main` branch trigger GitHub Actions
* CI workflow installs dependencies and runs pytest

</gsl-workflows>
<gsl-tdd>
<gsl-description>

## 5. Tests

Add single-line manual tests here. Each test should fully validate a required feature or edge case, and must be wrapped in a `<gsl-test>` element. Add a code block (triple backticks) below the description if needed.
</gsl-description>
<gsl-test id="T1">

- T1: Visiting [https://github.com/bynbb/obk/releases](https://github.com/bynbb/obk/releases) shows changelog and draft changes

    ```markdown
    ## What's Changed
    * Add gritlabs/obk-scaffold
    * Docs update articles by @bynbb in https://github.com/bynbb/obk/pull/1
    ...etc.
    ```

</gsl-test>
<gsl-test id="T2">

- T2: Commit errors locally without conventional tag

## 6. Document Specification

#### Overview

This section defines the rules and conventions for maintaining and updating this prompt document.
This specification applies only to this prompt document.

#### S-1. Identifier and Numbering

Major sections and tests in this document must use a clear, hierarchical ID. Use an uppercase prefix and numbers, like `T1`, `T2.1`, or `S1.2.3`:

* Use `T` for tests in `<gsl-tdd>` (e.g., `T1`, `T2.1`).
* Use `S` for specification items if needed (e.g., `S1`, `S2.1`).
* Number all items in order, with no gaps or repeats.
* Do not remove or change IDs except to fix errors.

These IDs are required for referencing, tracking, and audits.

#### S-2. Update Policy

These rules apply to automated changes by agents. Manual edits by maintainers can update any section.

* Agents **may only** update these sections:

  * `<gsl-workflows>` (agents may add, change, or remove any part)
  * `<gsl-tdd>` (agents may add new `<gsl-test>` elements, but may not change or remove any existing `<gsl-test>`)
* Agents **must not** change or remove any other content in this document.

These rules protect the integrity of the document and its tests, while allowing agents to add workflows and new tests.

#### S-3. Tests Section

* `<gsl-tdd>` holds one or more `<gsl-test>` elements.
* Each `<gsl-test>` must start with a single-line description and have a unique `id` (e.g., `T1`, `T2`, etc).
* You may add a code block (with triple backticks) below the test description if needed.
* Agents may only add new `<gsl-test>` elements. They must not change or remove any existing test.
* Only maintainers can change or remove tests.
* Use these tests for auditing and validation.
