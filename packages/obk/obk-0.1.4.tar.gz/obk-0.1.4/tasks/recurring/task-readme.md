## [Maintenance Task] Generate and Maintain a Minimal, Current README.md

**Objective:**  
Ensure the `README.md` at the repository root exists and accurately summarizes the current state of the `obk` codebase, providing essential installation, usage, and contribution instructions. The README should be concise, easy to follow, and should not exceed 80 lines.

* * *

### Steps

1. **Review Current Codebase**
    
    * Scan the codebase for current functionality, CLI commands, major modules, and setup steps.
        
    * Note any features, requirements, or usage examples needed for basic understanding.
        
2. **Create or Update README.md**
    
    * If no `README.md` exists, create one using the template provided below as a base, updating all placeholder values with actual project data.
        
    * If `README.md` exists, update it to accurately reflect the latest state of the project, following the template structure and style.
        
    * Ensure the README does not exceed 80 lines and contains only essential information. Avoid unnecessary detail or “changelog”/roadmap content.
        
3. **Standard Template**
    
    * The README must include (in this order):
        
        1. Project Title and brief description
            
        2. Installation/Requirements (commands for `pip`, etc.)
            
        3. Quickstart / Usage (CLI or API examples)
            
        4. Features or commands list (concise)
            
        5. Contribution guidelines (if relevant)
            
        6. License (if any)
            
    * You may omit Contribution or License if not applicable, but must stay within the line limit.
