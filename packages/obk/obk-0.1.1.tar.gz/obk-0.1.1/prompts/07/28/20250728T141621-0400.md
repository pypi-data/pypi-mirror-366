<!--
This is a self-contained prompt and spec for OBK/Codex agent work.
- Inputs, outputs, workflows, and tests are listed below.
- All document rules and agent policies are defined in the "Document Specification" section.
- Agents may only update workflows and add new tests (see rules).
- Everything else is for maintainers to edit as needed.
- This file should be easy to read and quick to update—no hidden steps or dependencies.

## 1. Purpose

Provide basic CLI features to kick off the `obk` CLI project. </gsl-purpose>

<gsl-inputs>

## 2. Inputs

This table lists key artifacts—tools, articles, or other sources—that directly guide or constrain the OBK scaffold.

<gsl-outputs>

## 3. Outputs

This section lists the main components produced by the OBK scaffold.

* Buildable `obk` CLI with behaviors from gritlabs
* Project root with entry point
* pyproject.toml for build/deps
* Minimal test skeleton (tests/test\_cli.py)

</gsl-outputs>

<gsl-workflows>

## 4. Workflows

This section lists the main steps or processes required to complete tasks in the project.

* Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory
* Install the package locally with `pip install -e .` (editable) or `pip install .` (standard)
* Verify installation by running `obk hello-world` from any directory (should print "hello world")
* (Optional) Install from PyPI: `pip install obk`
* Pushes to `work` branch trigger GitHub Actions
* CI workflow installs dependencies and runs pytest

</gsl-workflows>

<gsl-tdd>

## 5. Tests

Add single-line manual tests here. Each test should fully validate a required feature or edge case, and must be wrapped in a <gsl-test> element. Add a code block (triple backticks) below the description if needed.

<gsl-test id="T1">

- T1: Running `obk hello-world` prints "hello world" from any directory</gsl-test> <gsl-test id="T2">
- T2: Running `obk hello-world -h` shows help for the command</gsl-test> <gsl-test id="T3">
 
- T3: Running `python -m obk hello-world` prints "hello world"</gsl-test>

</gsl-tdd>

## 6. Document Specification

#### Overview

This section defines the rules and conventions for maintaining and updating this prompt document.
This specification applies only to this prompt document.

#### S-1. Identifier and Numbering

Major sections and tests in this document must use a clear, hierarchical ID. Use an uppercase prefix and numbers, like `T1`, `T2.1`, or `S1.2.3`:

* Use `T` for tests in `<gsl-tdd>` (e.g., `T1`, `T2.1`).
* Use `S` for specification items if needed (e.g., `S1`, `S2.1`).
* Number all items in order, with no gaps or repeats.
* Do not remove or change IDs except to fix errors.

These IDs are required for referencing, tracking, and audits.

#### S-2. Update Policy

These rules apply to automated changes by agents. Manual edits by maintainers can update any section.

* Agents **may only** update these sections:

  * `<gsl-workflows>` (agents may add, change, or remove any part)
  * `<gsl-tdd>` (agents may add new `<gsl-test>` elements, but may not change or remove any existing `<gsl-test>`)
* Agents **must not** change or remove any other content in this document.

These rules protect the integrity of the document and its tests, while allowing agents to add workflows and new tests.

#### S-3. Tests Section

* `<gsl-tdd>` holds one or more `<gsl-test>` elements.
* Each `<gsl-test>` must start with a single-line description and have a unique `id` (e.g., `T1`, `T2`, etc).
* You may add a code block (with triple backticks) below the test description if needed.
* Agents may only add new `<gsl-test>` elements. They must not change or remove any existing test.
* Only maintainers can change or remove tests.
* Use these tests for auditing and validation.
