"""
In the following code, I will look to build out the relevant variational framework
that will help with a number of trading algorithms and markets. The key element that will be spoken
about is the (1) general variational framework. The general variational framework will be critical
to these problems.

These techniques will widely applied to commodities trading and equities. The core innovation
with these techniques is that we can scale, and calculate quickly various constraints that are
found in traditional datasets.

    Integrating the g(x, x_start, x_end) between a and b.

    When doing this calculation, there are four points:

        (3) a
        (4) b

    Without loss of generality, one can take two things:

        (2) a < b
