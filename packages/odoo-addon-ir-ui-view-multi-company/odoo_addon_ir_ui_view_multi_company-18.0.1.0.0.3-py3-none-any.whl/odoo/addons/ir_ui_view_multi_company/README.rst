This module allows companies operating in a multi-company environment to
define custom views for specific companies. It extends the view model by
introducing a company_ids field, allowing views to be dedicated to
specific companies.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In complex multi-company environments, it is common for different
companies to require personalized views for the same model. Examples
include:

- Different workflows or business processes.
- Variations in required fields or field ordering.
- Regulatory or organizational differences between subsidiaries.

Previously, these needs were often addressed by assigning views to
security groups using the ``groups_id`` attribute. However, this is no
longer supported.

The ``ir_ui_view_multi_company`` module resolves this limitation by
introducing a dedicated ``company_ids`` field on views, ensuring that
views are only applied when the user is operating under the matching
company context.

Configuration
=============

1. Enable the multi-company feature in your Odoo instance.
2. To dedicate a view to a specific company:

   - Go to the technical menu: Settings > Technical > User Interface >
     Views.
   - Edit or create a view.
   - Set the ``Company`` field to the desired company.

The domain operator used to filter inheriting views by company (=,
parent_of, child_of, etc.) can be easily customized by overriding the
\_inheriting_views_domain_company_operator class attribute.
