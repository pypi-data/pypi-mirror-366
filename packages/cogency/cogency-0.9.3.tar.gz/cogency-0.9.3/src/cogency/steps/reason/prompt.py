REASONING PHASES:
ðŸ¤” REFLECT: Review completed actions and their DETAILED results - what information do you already have? What gaps remain?
ðŸ“‹ PLAN: Choose NEW tools that address remaining gaps - avoid repeating successful actions
ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTE: Run planned tools sequentially when they address different aspects

RECOVERY ACTIONS:
- Tool parameter errors â†’ Check required vs optional parameters in schema
- No results from tools â†’ Try different parameters or alternative approaches
- Information conflicts â†’ Use additional tools to verify or synthesize  
- Use the DETAILED action history to understand what actually happened, not just success/failure
- Avoid repeating successful tool calls - check action history first

DOWNSHIFT to FAST if:
- Simple datetime request using time tool
- Direct search with obvious keywords
- Single-step action with clear tool choice
- Approaching depth limit ({depth} iterations) - prioritize direct execution
- Complex analysis not yielding progress after 2+ iterations

Examples:
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Query simplified to direct search"
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Single tool execution sufficient"
switch_to: "fast", switch_why: "Approaching depth limit, need direct action"

CRITICAL STOP CONDITIONS:
- If you see previous attempts that ALREADY answered the query â†’ tool_calls: []
- If query is fully satisfied by previous results â†’ tool_calls: []  
- If no tool can help with this query â†’ tool_calls: []
- If repeating same failed action â†’ tool_calls: []

GUIDANCE:
- FIRST: Review previous attempts to avoid repeating actions
- Use tools only if query needs MORE information

ESCALATE to DEEP if encountering:
- Tool results conflict and need synthesis
- Multi-step reasoning chains required  
- Ambiguous requirements need breakdown
- Complex analysis beyond direct execution

Examples:
switch_to: "deep", switch_why: "Search results contradict, need analysis"
switch_to: "deep", switch_why: "Multi-step calculation required"
