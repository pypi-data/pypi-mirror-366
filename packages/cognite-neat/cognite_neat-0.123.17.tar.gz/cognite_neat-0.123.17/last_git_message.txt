Remove unnecessary method and check (#1252)

# Description

Previously we allowed for re-definition of properties (i.e., having
several definition of the same property in
`SheetList[ConceptualProperty|PhysicalProperty]`). Sometime ago we added
more strict validation which does not allow this behavior. However, a
method and check that looking for the redefinitions, which safeguard
against it, pertained for ontology exporter. This PR removes them, as
such edge case cannot longer happen (due to tougher validation at the
source).
