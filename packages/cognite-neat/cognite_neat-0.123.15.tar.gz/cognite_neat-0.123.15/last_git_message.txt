Deeper conceptual dm validation (#1251)

# Description

Significantly improved and much deeper validation of conceptual data
model. The change was necessary as we have now much more flexible
conceptual data modeling capabilities, which call for better data model
validation.

The improved validation consists of:
- deeper check all ancestors are defined (defined means have at least
one property either directly defined, or inherited through other
ancestors)
- if object type properties use concepts that are defined within the
data model


In addition: 
- previously there was possibility to collected duplicated validation
issues, which now is avoided
- improved naming of validation methods (which are private)
