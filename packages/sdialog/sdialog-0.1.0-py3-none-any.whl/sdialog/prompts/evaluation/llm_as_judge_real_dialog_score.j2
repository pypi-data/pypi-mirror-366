{% set is_plural = dialogs|length > 1 %}
Given the following {{ "dialogues" if is_plural else "dialogue" }}, rate how REAL (human-like) or SYNTHETIC (machine-generated) {{ "they are" if is_plural else "it is" }} on a Likert scale from {{ min_score }} to {{ max_score }}.

A {{ "dialogue" if not is_plural else "dialogues" }} should be considered more REAL (human) if {{ "each demonstrates" if is_plural else "it demonstrates" }} characteristics such as:
- Sufficient length and depth (not just a short or trivial exchange)
- Natural flow and coherence between turns
- Realistic, contextually appropriate responses
- Evidence of genuine intent, emotion, or subtlety in interaction
- Natural conversational style, including possible hesitations, self-corrections, informal expressions, or filler words (e.g., "um", "well", "you know")
- Absence of obvious artifacts of machine generation (e.g., generic, repetitive, or unnatural phrasing)
- Consistency in persona, style, and topic progression

If {{ "any dialogue is" if is_plural else "the dialogue is" }} too short, lacks depth, lacks natural conversational style, or seems artificial, it should receive a lower score (closer to {{ min_score }}).

Rate each {{ "dialogue" if not is_plural else "of the dialogues" }} using the following Likert scale:
{{ min_score }} = Definitely SYNTHETIC (machine-generated)
{{ max_score }} = Definitely REAL (human)
(Use intermediate values to indicate gradations between synthetic and real.)

Below, each dialogue is delimited by:
[[ ## BEGIN DIALOGUE N ## ]]
...dialogue text...
[[ ## END DIALOGUE N ## ]]
where N is the dialogue index in the list.

{{ "Dialogues:" if is_plural else "Dialogue:" }}
{% if is_plural %}
{% for d in dialogs %}
[[ ## BEGIN DIALOGUE {{ loop.index }} ## ]]
{{ d }}
[[ ## END DIALOGUE {{ loop.index }} ## ]]
