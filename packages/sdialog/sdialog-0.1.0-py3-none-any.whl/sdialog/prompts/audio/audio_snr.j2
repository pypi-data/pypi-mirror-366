Your task is to rewrite the following dialogue by adding a quantitative Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) attribute to each speaker's tag.

The `snr` attribute should be a numerical integer representing decibels (dB) that estimates the audio quality based on the conversational context. Assign a value from the following ranges:

- **Quiet Environment (e.g., a library, a private office):** Assign an SNR value between **25 and 35**.
- **Medium Noise Environment (e.g., a typical office, a quiet cafe):** Assign an SNR value between **10 and 20**.
- **Loud Environment (e.g., a busy street, a construction site, a crowded bar):** Assign an SNR value between **0 and 10**.

The dialogue content, speakers, and order must remain exactly the same. You should only add the `snr` attribute to each speaker tag in the format `snr="XX"`.

Here is an example of the expected transformation:

Original Turn:
[DOCTOR] Hello, how can I help you today?
[PATIENT] I'm on a busy street and can barely hear you!

Modified Turn:
[DOCTOR snr="32"] Hello, how can I help you today?
[PATIENT snr="8"] I'm on a busy street and can barely hear you!

Here is the original dialogue:
{{ dialog }}

Return only the modified dialogue with the `snr` attributes included in the speaker tags.
