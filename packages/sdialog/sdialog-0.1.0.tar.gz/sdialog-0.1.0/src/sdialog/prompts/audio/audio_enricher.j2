Your task is to rewrite the following dialogue by inserting appropriate audio clue tags.
The tags should follow an XML-like syntax. There are two types of tags:

1. **Span tags**: For events that last for a duration of text. The format is `<label>text</label>`.
   - `label` is the name of the audio event (e.g., `keyboard_typing`, `ac_noise`).
   - Example: `I need to <keyboard_typing>finish this email</keyboard_typing> before I leave.`

2. **Point tags**: For instantaneous events. The format is `<label duration="Xms" overlapping="True|False" />`.
   - `label` is the name of the audio event (e.g., `cough`, `door_slam`).
   - `duration` is an optional attribute for the duration in milliseconds (e.g., `duration="20ms"`).
   - `overlapping` should be `True` if the audio can happen during speech, and `False` otherwise.
   - Example: `Please Mr. Dupont enter the room <door_slam overlapping="False" />, how are you today?`

You can use labels like `steps`, `door_opening`, `door_closing`, `footsteps`, `car_engine`, `ac_noise`,
`keyboard_typing`, `phone_ringing`, `doorbell_ringing`, `cough`, `sneeze`, `sigh`, `laughter`.
Use snake_case for labels with multiple words.

The dialogue content, speakers, and order must remain exactly the same. You should only add the audio tags.

Here is the original dialogue:
