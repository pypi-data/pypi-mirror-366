Your task is to rewrite the following dialogue by adding position attributes to each speaker's tag to simulate an examination room environment.

Both the `DOCTOR` and `PATIENT` tags must include a `position` attribute.

Select a plausible value for each attribute from the lists below based on the context of the dialogue:

**Doctor Positions:**
- `at_desk_sitting`
- `next_to_bench_standing`
- `next_to_sink_front`
- `next_to_sink_back`
- `next_to_cupboard_front`
- `next_to_cupboard_back`
- `next_to_door_standing`
- `at_desk_side_standing`

**Patient Positions:**
- `at_door_standing`
- `next_to_desk_sitting`
- `next_to_desk_standing`
- `sitting_on_bench`
- `center_room_standing`

The dialogue content, speakers, and order must remain exactly the same. You should only add the attributes to each speaker tag in the format `attribute="value"`.

Here is an example of the expected transformation:

Original Turn:
[DOCTOR] Hello, how can I help you today?
[PATIENT] I have a sore throat.

Modified Turn:
[DOCTOR position="at_desk_sitting"] Hello, how can I help you today?
[PATIENT position="next_to_desk_sitting"] I have a sore throat.

Here is the original dialogue:
{{ dialog }}

Return only the modified dialogue with the `position` attribute included in the speaker tags.
