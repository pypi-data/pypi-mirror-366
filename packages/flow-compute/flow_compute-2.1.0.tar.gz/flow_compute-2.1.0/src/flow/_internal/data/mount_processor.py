"""Generic mount processing for data sources.

Provider-agnostic mount handling:
- Validation: Early failure with actionable error messages
- Resolution: URL to mount specification conversion
- No provider-specific logic

The MountProcessor is responsible for:
1. Validating mount specifications (paths, duplicates, system directories)
2. Resolving URLs to concrete mount specifications via URLResolver
3. Maintaining clean separation from provider-specific adaptations

Mount flow:
1. User specifies mounts in Flow.run() or CLI
2. MountProcessor validates and resolves URLs
3. Provider-specific adapter (e.g., FCPMountAdapter) converts to provider format
4. Provider attaches volumes or sets environment variables
5. Instance startup scripts handle runtime mounting
