"""Provider interface protocols for Flow SDK.

This module defines the core contracts for cloud provider implementations.
All protocols use structural typing via Python's Protocol class, enabling
duck typing with static analysis.

The module provides three main protocol categories:
  - IComputeProvider: GPU instance lifecycle management
  - IStorageProvider: Persistent volume operations
  - IProvider: Combined compute + storage + user management

These protocols enable dependency inversion where core depends on abstractions
rather than implementations, allowing new providers to extend functionality
without modifying core SDK code.
