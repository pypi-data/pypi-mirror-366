"""Flow CLI commands.

Commands are modular with automatic discovery:
- Each command in its own module (e.g., run.py for 'flow run')
- Modules export a 'command' instance implementing BaseCommand
- Commands are auto-registered via COMMAND_MODULES list

Example:
    Adding a new command:
    1. Create mycommand.py implementing BaseCommand
    2. Add to imports: from . import mycommand
    3. Add to COMMAND_MODULES list
