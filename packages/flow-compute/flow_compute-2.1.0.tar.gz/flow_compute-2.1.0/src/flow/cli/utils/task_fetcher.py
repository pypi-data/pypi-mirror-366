"""Centralized task fetching service for Flow CLI.

This module provides efficient task fetching logic that prioritizes active tasks
and handles large task lists gracefully. It solves the common problem where
newer active tasks might not appear in paginated results when fetching from
oldest-first APIs.

Design principles:
- Single source of truth for task fetching logic
- Optimized for common use cases (canceling/viewing active tasks)
- Handles pagination edge cases transparently
- Provides consistent behavior across all CLI commands
