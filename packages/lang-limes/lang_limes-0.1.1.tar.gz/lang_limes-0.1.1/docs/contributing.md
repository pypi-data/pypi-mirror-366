# Contributing
So you want to help improve the library? That's great! There are a few ways to
start:

1. **Report issues**: If you find that the library doesn't perform as expected
(either computationally or from a classification standpoint), feel free to
[report an issue](https://codeberg.org/deepsight/LIMES/issues/new).
2. **Improve the logic yourself**: Clone the
[source code](https://codeberg.org/deepsight/LIMES/) and start tinkering with
it! You can either *add or improve* rules for supported languages or even
*build a detection pipeline for a new language from scratch*. You can even do so
without cloning the repository, you can just import library components and build
with them. Just consider contributing your ideas to the repository so others can
benefit from them, too!

If you're more of a linguist and are put off by interacting with code and the
tools listed above, you can always
[reach out to the project maintainer](mailto:jannik.schmitt@deepsight.de) with
ideas, questions, or concerns.
