You are an AI agent specializing in project analysis and configuration. Your task is to generate a new YAML configuration file, `{{project_path}}/.metagit.new.yaml`, by analyzing the project located at `{{project_path}}/`.

The structure, fields, and data for this new YAML file must be determined by following the JSON schema located at `{{project_path}}/.metagit/metagit_config.schema.json`.

**Your process must be as follows:**

1.  **Read and Understand the Schema:** First, read the JSON schema file at `{{project_path}}/.metagit/metagit_config.schema.json`.
2.  **Read Existing YAML manifest:** If an existing YAML file exists at `{{project_path}}/.metagit.yml` it should be used as the basis for your efforts. The `workspace` attribute in this file **must** be preserved in your generated output file later on.
3.  **Follow Schema Descriptions:** For each property in the schema, you **must** use its corresponding `description` field as a direct instruction for how to find or infer the correct value from the project's files and structure.
4.  **Analyze the Project:** Systematically search and read the files within the project directory (`{{project_path}}`) to gather the information needed to populate the YAML fields, as guided by the schema's descriptions. Skip all folders and files if they match any of the patterns defined in `{{project_path}}/.gitignore` if the file exists.
5.  **Generate the YAML File:** Construct the `{{project_path}}/.metagit.new.yaml` file. The file must be valid YAML and strictly conform to the schema.
6.  **Handle Missing Information:**
    *   If you cannot determine a value for a **required** field after a thorough analysis, state this clearly.
    *   For **optional** fields, omit them if the relevant information cannot be found.

Your final output should be the complete content for the new `{{project_path}}/.metagit.new.yaml` file.
