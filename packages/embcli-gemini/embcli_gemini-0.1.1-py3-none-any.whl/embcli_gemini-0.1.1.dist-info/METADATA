gemini plugin for embcli, a command-line interface for embeddings.

## Reference

- [Gemini Embedding Experimental](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-embedding)
- [Gemini Text Embedding and Embedding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#text-embedding)

## Installation

```bash
pip install embcli-gemini
```

## Quick Start

You need Gemini API key to use this plugin. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file in the current directory. Or you can give the env file path by `-e` option.

```bash
cat .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_KEY>
```

### Try out the Embedding Models

```bash
# show general usage of emb command.
emb --help

# list all available models.
emb models
GeminiEmbeddingModel
    Vendor: gemini
    Models:
    * gemini-embedding-exp-03-07 (aliases: exp-03-07)
    * text-embedding-004 (aliases: text-004)
    * embedding-001 (aliases: )
    Model Options:
    * task_type (str) - The type of task for the embedding. Supported task types: 'semantic_similarity', 'classification', 'clustering', 'retrieval_document', 'retrieval_query', 'question_answering', 'fact_verification', 'code_retrieval_query'

# get an embedding for an input text by text-embedding-004 model.
emb embed -m text-004 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input text by text-embedding-004 model with task_type=retrieval_query.
emb embed -m text-004 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o task_type retrieval_query

# calculate similarity score between two texts by text-embedding-004 model. the default metric is cosine similarity.
emb simscore -m text-004 "The cat drifts toward sleep." "Sleep dances in the cat's eyes."
0.8025767622661093
```

### Document Indexing and Search

You can use the `emb` command to index documents and perform search by an image. `emb` uses [`LanceDB`](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) for the default vector database.

```bash
# index example documents in the current directory.
emb ingest-sample -m text-004 -c catcafe --corpus cat-names-en

# or, you can give the path to your documents.
# the documents should be in a CSV file with two columns: id and text. the separator should be comma.
emb ingest -m text-004 -c catcafe -f <path-to-your-documents>

# search for a query in the indexed documents.
emb search -m text-004 -c catcafe -q "Who's the naughtiest one?"
