A reimplementation of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool in Rust, designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative,
while also providing some additional opinionated features.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in early stage of development, only a few of the original pre-commit features are implemented.
> It is not production-ready yet, but feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
>
> Current supported languages are `python`, `nodejs`, `docker`, `docker-image`, `system`, `script` and `fail`.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was previously named `pre-commit-rs`, but it was renamed to `prefligit` to prevent confusion with the existing pre-commit tool.
> See [#73](https://github.com/j178/prefligit/issues/73) for more information.

## Features

- A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- Improved performance in hook preparation and execution.
- Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- Built-in implementation of some common hooks.
- (TODO) Built-in support for monorepos.

## Usage

This tool is designed to be a drop-in alternative for the original pre-commit tool, so you can use it with your existing configurations and hooks.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) for more information on how to configure and use pre-commit.

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn't be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I've learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.
