Official Nano-Wait Library: Precise and Adaptive Waiting in Python ⚡

Description: This library allows you to perform adaptive waiting based on the current performance of your computer

### 📦 Installation


⚠️ To download it is necessary to have two libraries to work, run in the terminal 'pip install psutil pywifi⚠️ 

### Compatibility

⚠️ Compatibility: For now it only works on Windows, we are working on it now :) ⚠️ 

### Version

Version: 1.2
License: MIT

### formulas

Formulas used in the NanoWait library:

1) PC Score Calculation:
Evaluates how "free" your computer is based on CPU and memory usage:: 

cpu_score = max(0, min(10, 10 - cpu_usage / 10)) 

memory_score = max(0, min(10, 10 - memory_usage / 10)) 

pc_score = (cpu_score + memory_score) / 2

2) Wi-Fi Score calculation:
Converts Wi-Fi signal strength (in dBm) to a scale of 0 to 10: 

wifi_score = max(0, min(10, (signal_strength + 100) / 10)) 

Example: If the signal is -60 dBm, 
wifi_score = (-60 + 100) / 10 = 4

3) Combined Risk Score Calculation (PC + Wi-Fi): 

risk_score = (pc_score + wifi_score) / 2

4) Wi-Fi standby time (wait_wifi): 

wait_time = max(1, (10 - risk_score) / speed)

5) Waiting time without Wi-Fi (wait_n_wifi): 

wait_time = max(1, (10 - pc_score) / speed)

# Efficiency Comparison: NanoWait vs. Fixed Wait (Guess)

This snippet mathematically explains how much the NanoWait library can improve wait time efficiency compared to a fixed wait performed by "guessing."

## Formula for calculating adaptive wait time (NanoWait)

For Wi-Fi, the wait time is calculated by:

\[
wait\_time = \max\left(min\_wait, \frac{10 - risk\_score}{speed}\right)
\]

Where:

- \( risk\_score = \frac{pc\_score + wifi\_score}{2} \) — combined score of the computer's performance and Wi-Fi network quality (varies between 0 and 10).
- \( speed \) — configurable factor that indicates the desired speed (higher values generate shorter wait times).
- \( min\_wait \) — minimum wait time allowed (example: 0.05 seconds).

---

## Percentage Gain Calculation

The percentage gain in efficiency, comparing the fixed wait \( t_{fixed} \) with the adaptive wait time \( wait\_time \), is:

\[
G = \frac{t_{fixed} - wait\_time}{t_{fixed}} \times 100\%
\]

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario A — Very Good PC and Wi-Fi

- \( pc\_score = 9 \)
- \( wifi\_score = 9 \)
- \( risk\_score = 9 \)
- \( speed = 10 \)
- \( min\_wait = 0.05 \) seconds

Calculating the wait time:

\[
wait\_time = \max(0.05, \frac{10 - 9}{10}) = \max(0.05, 0.1) = 0.1 \text{ seconds}
\]

If the fixed time is 0.2 seconds, the gain is:

\[
G = \frac{0.2 - 0.1}{0.2} \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

**Conclusion:** NanoWait halves the wait time.

---

### Scenario B — Reasonable PC and Poor Wi-Fi

- \( pc\_score = 5 \)
- \( wifi\_score = 3 \)
- \( risk\_score = 4 \)
- \( speed = 5 \)
- \( min\_wait = 0.05 \) seconds

Calculating the wait time:

\[
wait\_time = \max(0.05, \frac{10 - 4}{5}) = \max(0.05, 1.2) = 1.2 \text{ seconds}
\]

If the fixed time is 1 second, the gain is:

\[
G = \frac{1 - 1.2}{1} \times 100\% = -20\%
\]

**Conclusion:** Longer wait to ensure stability, which is important to avoid errors.

---

### Scenario C — Good PC, Average Wi-Fi

- \( pc\_score = 8 \)
- \( wifi\_score = 5 \)
- \( risk\_score = 6.5 \)
- \( speed = 10 \)
- \( min\_wait = 0.05 \) seconds

Calculating the wait time:

\[
wait\_time = \max(0.05, \frac{10 - 6.5}{10}) = \max(0.05, 0.35) = 0.35 \text{ seconds}
\]

If the fixed time is 0.5 seconds, the gain is:

\[
G = \frac{0.5 - 0.35}{0.5} \times 100\% = 30%
\]

**Conclusion:** 30% savings in total wait time.

---
## Summary

| Condition | Estimated Gain (%) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Very good PC and Wi-Fi | Up to 50% reduction in wait time |
| Reasonable PC, poor Wi-Fi | Can increase the time for robustness |
| Good PC, average Wi-Fi | Approximately 20% to 35% savings |

---

## Practical Benefits of NanoWait

- **Adaptive time savings**: wait time decreases when the system is under stress.
- **Robustness**: time increases when the system is under stress, avoiding errors.
- **Customization**: the `speed` parameter allows you to adjust the behavior to your needs.

---

In other words, on average, it's a 20% to 50% increase in efficiency.

### ⚠️ Error Handling

The **Nano-Wait** library is designed with robust fallback mechanisms to ensure stability, even under unexpected conditions.

#### ✅ How the library behaves in case of failures:

| Scenario                        | Behavior                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wi-Fi network not found**     | Returns a Wi-Fi score of `0` and logs: `[WiFi Error]`                   |
| **CPU or RAM usage unavailable**| Returns a PC score of `0` and logs: `[PC Score Error]`                  |
| **Unexpected internal error**   | Falls back to `time.sleep(t)` and logs: `[Error nano_wait]`            |

#### 🔐 Why this matters:

- Ensures **safe execution** even when the system is under high load or lacks necessary permissions.
- Avoids crashes by using default behaviors in case of unexpected conditions.
- Ideal for **automation scripts** and **real-time systems** that require reliability and resilience.
