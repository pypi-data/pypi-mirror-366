              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Introduction

ACMC is a tool that automates the verification, translation and organisation of medical coding lists defining  phenotypes for inclusion criteria in cohort analysis. By processing externally sourced clinical inclusion criteria into actionable code lists, this tool ensures consistent and efficient curation of cohort definitions. These code lists can be subsequently used by data providers to construct study cohorts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher

## Installation

To install the `acmc` package, simply run:

```bash
pip install acmc
```

Once installed, you'll be ready to use the `acmc` tool along with the associated vocabularies.

## **Example Usage**

Follow these steps to initialize and manage a phenotype using `acmc`. In this example, we use a source concept list for the Concept Set `Abdominal Pain` created from [ClinicalCodes.org](ClinicalCodes.org). The source concept codes are read2. We genereate versioned phenotypes for read2 and translate to snomed in normalised, standard formats. 

1. **Initialize a phenotype in the workspace**

	Use the followijng `acmc` command to initialize the phenotype in a local Git repository:

```bash
acmc phen init
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Initialising Phenotype in directory: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Creating phen directory structure and config files
[INFO] - Phenotype initialised successfully
```

2. **Copy example medical code lists to the phenotype codes directory**

	From the command prompt, copy medical code lists `/examples/codes`to the phenotype code directory:

```bash
cp -r ./examples/concepts/* ./workspace/phen/concepts
```

   - You can view the source code list here [`res176-abdominal-pain.csv`](.//examples/codes/clinical-codes-org/Symptom%20code%20lists/Abdominal%20pain/res176-abdominal-pain.csv)
   - Alternatively, place your code lists in `./workspace/phen/codes`.

3. **Copy the example phenotype configuration file to the phenotype directory**

	From the command prompt, copy example phenotype configuration files `/examples/config.json` to the phenotype directory:

```bash
cp -r ./examples/config1.yml ./workspace/phen/config.yml
```

   - You can view the configuarion file here [`config.json`](./examples/config.json) 
   - Alternatively, place your own `config.json` file in `./workspace/phen`.
     
4. **Validate the phenotype configuration**

	Use the followijng `acmc` command to validate the phenotype configuration to ensure it's correct:

```bash
acmc phen validate
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
```

5. **Generate phenotype in Read2 code format**

	Use the following `acmc` command to generate the phenotype in `read2` format:

```bash
acmc phen map -t read2
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Processing phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - Processing read2 codes for <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen/concepts/clinical-codes-org/Symptom code lists/Abdominal pain/res176-abdominal-pain.csv
[INFO] - Converting to target code type read2
[INFO] - Saved mapped concepts to <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen/map/read2.csv
[INFO] - Phenotype processed target code type read2
[INFO] - Phenotype processed successfully
```

The concept sets translating read2 to the acmc normalised CSV format will be stored in `./workspace/phen/concept-set/snomed/` in, e.g. `./workspace/phen/concept-set/read2/ABDO_PAIN.csv`.

6. **Publish phenotype at an initial version**

	Use the following `acmc` command to publish the phenotype at an initial version:

```bash
acmc phen publish
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - New version: 0.0.1
[INFO] - Phenotype published successfully
```

7. **Generate phenotype in Read3 code format**

Generate the phenotype in `read3` format:

```bash
acmc phen map -t read3
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Processing phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - Processing read2 codes for <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen/concepts/clinical-codes-org/Symptom code lists/Abdominal pain/res176-abdominal-pain.csv
[INFO] - Converting to target code type read3
[INFO] - Saved mapped concepts to <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen/map/read3.csv
[INFO] - Phenotype processed target code type read3
[INFO] - Phenotype processed successfully
```

The concept sets translating read2 to snomed will be stored in acmc CSV format in `./workspace/phen/concept-set/snomed/`, e.g. `./workspace/phen/concept-set/snomed/ABDO_PAIN.csv`

8. **Compare the previous version `0.0.1` with the latest version**

	Use the following `acmc` command to compare the previous version `0.0.1` with the latest version in the workspace phen directory:

```bash
acmc phen diff -ov 0.0.1
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: ./workspace/v1.0.3/
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: <path>/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - Phenotypes diff'd successfully
```

A report comparing the phenotype versions will be created in the workspace called './workspace/phen/latest_0.0.1_diff.md'

9. **Publish the phenotype at a major version**

	Use the following `acmc` command to publish the phenotype at a major version:

```bash
acmc phen publish -i major
```

Expected Output:

```bash
[INFO] - Validating phenotype: /home/mjbonifa/datahdd/brcbat/derived_datasets/mjbonifa/concepts-processing/workspace/phen
[INFO] - Phenotype validated successfully
[INFO] - New version: 1.0.0
[INFO] - Phenotype published successfully
```
