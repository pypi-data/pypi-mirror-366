* `fusion_evidence_matching.ipynb`: Demonstrates evidence matching workflow between assayed fusions (i.e. fusions from patient samples) and categorical fusions (i.e. fusions from genomic knowledgebases such as CIViC). The example queried fusions in this notebook are KIF5B::RET and EML4::ALK. Fusions are matched at the gene symbol, transcript accession, exon number, exon offset, and genomic breakpoint for each transcript segment, along with the linker sequence joining the two segments (if present). The highest possible match score is 11 points, and the categorical fusions with the highest score are returned in the matching algorithm along with their associated score.
