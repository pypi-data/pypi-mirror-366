   :pdfposter -mLegal -p1x1m -w10% -C5 input.pdf out.pdf:
       Scale a postscript image to a poster of about 1 square meter,
       printing on 'Legal' media, maintaining a 10% of 'Legal' size

:pdfposter -m10x10cm -pa0 a4.pdf out.pdf:
  Just to show how efficient ``pdfposter`` is: This will create a file
  containing 192 pages, but only 15 times as big as the single page.
  With a4.pdf being a quite empty page, this ratio should be even
  better for filled pages.
