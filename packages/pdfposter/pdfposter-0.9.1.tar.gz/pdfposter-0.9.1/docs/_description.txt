``pdfposter`` can be used to create a large poster by building it from
multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

.. comment
  The output pages bear cutmarks and have slightly overlapping
  images for easier assembling.

The program uses a simple but efficient method which is possible with
PDF: All new pages share the same data stream of the scaled page. Thus
resulting file grows moderately.

To control its operation, you need to specify either the size of the
desired poster or a scale factor for the image:

- Given the poster size, it calculates the required number of sheets
  to print on, and from that a scale factor to fill these sheets
  optimally with the input image.

- Given a scale factor, it derives the required number of pages from
  the input image size, and positions the scaled image centered on
  this area.
