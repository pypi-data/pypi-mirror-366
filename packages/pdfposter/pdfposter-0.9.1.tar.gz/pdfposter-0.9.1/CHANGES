0.9.1 (2025-08-03)
------------------

* Fix missing localization files in distribution.
  Actually all translations have been missing.

* Fix missing translation for Python < 3.10 argparse.

* Update translations.

* Add missing copyright texts, license identifiers and license files.

* Lots of cleanup to the test, build and packaging process.


0.9.post2 (2025-07-28)
----------------------

* Fix scaling the page. This was totally broken in version 0.9, leading to
  empty pages.

* Drop support for Python 3.7. The required version of the library pdfposter
  is based on doesn't support that version any longer.

* Translate more strings. Update translations.


0.9.post1 (2025-07-22)
----------------------

* Fix packaging and upload to PyPI.


0.9 (2025-07-22)
----------------

* Rename the package and module to just `pdfposter`, which was the original
  name.

* Add support for localization.  Languages currently supported are: German,
  French (thanks to LS-Localicows), Spanish and Swedish (thanks to
  Stefan2255).

  Contributions for more languages are welcome. Please check out
  https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/pdftools/.

* Improve documentation.

* Add support for Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
  Drop support for Python 3.6.

* Port to version 3 of the `pypdf` library (thanks to psykose).



0.8.1 (2022-11-04)
------------------

* Fix box-scaling which was totally buggy in release 0.8
  (and I wonder why nobody noticed).

* Fix plural forms in info messages.


0.8 (2022-06-27)
----------------

* Be less strict when reading PDF files.

* Enhance some help messages.

* Drop support for Python 2 and Python <= 3.5. Minimum supported versions are
  now 3.6 to 3.10.

* Internal changes:

  - Update required version of `PyPDF` to 2.1.1.
  - Enhance code quality.


0.7 (2018-06-24)
----------------

* Incompatible change: `DIN lang` and `Envelope No. 10` are now defined as
  landscape formats.

* New options ``-f``/``--first`` and ``-l``/``--last`` for specifying the
  first resp. last page to convert

* Reduce the size of the output file a lot. Now the output file is
  nearly the same size as the input file. While this behaviour was
  intended from the beginning, it was not yet implemented for two
  reasons: The content was a) copied for each print-page and b) not
  compressed.

* Make the content of each page appear only once in the output file.
  This vastly reduces the size of the output file. 

* Compress page content. Now the output file is nearly the same size
  as the input file in much more cases. I thought, the underlying
  library will do this automatically, but it does not.

* Fix bug in PDF code used for clipping the page content. Many thanks
  to Johannes BrÃ¶del for reporting this bug.

* Add support for Python 3.

* Use `PyPFDF2` instead of the unmaintained `pyPDF`.


0.6.0 (2013-05-21)
-----------------------------

* New option ``-A``/``--art-box`` to use the content area defined by the
  ArtBox instead of the TrimBox.

* The page is now clipped to the TrimBox resp. ArtBox to ensure
  nothing outside of this box gets printed.

* No longer set the CropBox, as this is interpreted quite differently
  by different renderers (even if the PDF 1.7 standard defines its
  behaviour).

* Pages are now ordered top to bottom. This is a more natural for
  humans used to starting at the upper left. Thanks to Robert Schroll
  for the patch.

* Smaller enhancements, e.g. more precise error massages, better error
  handling, etc.


0.5.0 (2009-04-20)
-----------------------------

* Fix source-distribution package: The Python source-files have been
  missing.


0.4.6 (2009-01-04)
-----------------------------

* Open PDF files in binary mode.
* Fixes to the SConscript file.
