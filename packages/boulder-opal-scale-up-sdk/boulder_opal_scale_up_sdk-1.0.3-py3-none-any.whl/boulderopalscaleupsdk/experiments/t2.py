    delays_ns : list[int] | RangeIterable
        The delay time, in nanoseconds.
    virtual_detuning : float
        The difference between the drive signal frequency and the qubit frequency, in Hz.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay time between consecutive shots of the experiment, in nanoseconds.
        Defaults to 100_000 ns.
