# LLM Context Configuration

# This file controls which files are included in the LLM context output.
# Patterns follow gitignore syntax.

# Mode declaration (REQUIRED: must be first non-comment line)
WHITELIST:
# Start with no files, explicitly add what you want
src/
lib/
*.md

# Optional configuration  
OPTIONS:
output: my-context.md
respect_gitignore: true    # default: true
include_hidden: false      # default: false  
include_binary: false      # default: false

# Explicit sections for refinement
EXCLUDE:
# Remove files matching these patterns
**/__pycache__/
**/*.test.js
temp/

INCLUDE:
# Force-include files matching these patterns (rescue from exclusions)
.github/workflows/*.yml
debug.log

# Alternative example using BLACKLIST mode:
# BLACKLIST:
# # Start with all files, explicitly remove what you don't want
# tests/
# node_modules/
# coverage/
# *.log
# .git/
# 
# INCLUDE:
# # Force-include specific files despite blacklist
# tests/fixtures/
# tests/utils.py

# Notes:
# - Mode declaration (WHITELIST: or BLACKLIST:) must be first non-comment line
# - WHITELIST: Start with no files, add what you want
# - BLACKLIST: Start with all files, remove what you don't want  
# - EXCLUDE: Additional exclusions beyond gitignore
# - INCLUDE: Force-include files that would otherwise be excluded
# - CLI mode flags (-w/-b) completely override this file
# - Individual CLI flags override corresponding OPTIONS
