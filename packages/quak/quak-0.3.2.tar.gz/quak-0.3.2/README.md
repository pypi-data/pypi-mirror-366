**quak** is a scalable data profiler for quickly scanning large tables,
capturing interactions as executable SQL queries.

- **interactive** üñ±Ô∏è mouse over column summaries, cross-filter, sort, and slice rows.
- **fast** ‚ö° built with [Mosaic](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic); views are expressed as SQL queries lazily executed by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
- **flexible** üîÑ supports many data types and formats via [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html), the [dataframe interchange protocol](https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html), and the [Arrow PyCapsule Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html).
- **reproducible** üìì a UI for building complex SQL queries; materialize views in the kernel for further analysis.

## install

```sh
pip install quak
```

## usage

The easiest way to get started with **quak** is using the IPython
[cell magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).

```python
%load_ext quak
```

```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_parquet("https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/raw/main/data/athletes.parquet")
df
```

**quak** hooks into Jupyter's display mechanism to automatically render any
dataframe-like object (implementing the [Python dataframe interchange
protocol](https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html) or [Arrow PyCapsule Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html))
using `quak.Widget` instead of the default display.

Alternatively, you can use `quak.Widget` directly:

```python
import polars as pl
import quak

df = pl.read_parquet("https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/raw/main/data/athletes.parquet")
widget = quak.Widget(df)
widget
```

### interacting with the data

**quak** captures all user interactions as _queries_.

At any point, table state can be accessed as SQL,

```python
widget.sql # SELECT * FROM df WHERE ...
```

which for convenience can be executed in the kernel to materialize the view for further analysis:

```python
widget.data() # returns duckdb.DuckDBPyRelation object
```

By representing UI state as SQL, **quak** makes it easy to generate complex
queries via interactions that would be challenging to write manually, while
keeping them reproducible.

### using quak in marimo

**quak** can also be used in [**marimo** notebooks](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo),
which provide out-of-the-box support for anywidget:

```python
import marimo as mo
import polars as pl
import quak

df = pl.read_parquet("https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/raw/main/data/athletes.parquet")
widget = mo.ui.anywidget(quak.Widget(df))
widget
```
