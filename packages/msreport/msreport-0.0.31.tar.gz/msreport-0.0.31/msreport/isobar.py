"""Provides a transformer class for processing isobarically labeled proteomics data.

This module defines the `IsotopeImpurityCorrecter` class for processing of isobaric
(e.g., TMT, iTRAQ) reporter intensities. This transformer must be fitted with an isotope
impurity matrix to correct interference in reporter intensities. Once fitted, the
transformer can then be applied to a table containing reporter ion intensities to adjust
its intensity values. The transformation returns a new copy of the table with the
processed values, leaving the original table unchanged.
