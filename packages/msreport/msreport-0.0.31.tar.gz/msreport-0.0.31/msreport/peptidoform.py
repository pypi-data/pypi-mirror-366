"""Defines the `Peptide` class and associated utilities for handling peptidoforms.

This module provides a `Peptide` class for representing modified peptide sequences,
and their site localization probabilities. It offers methods to access and manipulate
peptide information, summarize isoform probabilities, and retrieve modification sites.
Additionally, it includes utility functions for parsing modified sequence strings and
converting site localization probabilities to and from a standardized string format.
