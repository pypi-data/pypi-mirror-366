"""
All this file is currently in 'yta_multimedia' library
because I'm testing it, but the concepts contained in
this file don't belong to this library because they are
related to a VideoEditor concept, not to image or video
simple editing.

We need to handle, when working in building a whole video
project, videos as SubClips so we handle all attributes
and, if we subclip a SubClip instance, we .copy() the
previous attributes to the left, center and right clips
we obtain when subclipping. This would preserve previous
configurations and let us manage all the clips, so we
work on top of moviepy library in any change we process
and use moviepy only for basic and frame transformations.

TODO: These classes below will be moved in a near future
to its own project or to 'youtube_autonomous'.
