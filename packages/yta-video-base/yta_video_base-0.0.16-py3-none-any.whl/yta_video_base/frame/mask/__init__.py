Extracted from official documentation:

The fundamental difference between masks and standard clips is that standard clips output frames with 3 components (R-G-B) per pixel, comprised between 0 and 255, while a mask has just one composant per pixel, between 0 and 1 (1 indicating a fully visible pixel and 0 a transparent pixel). Seen otherwise, a mask is always in greyscale.
