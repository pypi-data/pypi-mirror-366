class User(Model):
    id = IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    name = CharField(max_length=100)
    email = CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)

async def main():
    await connect("postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb")
    user = await User.create(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com")
    users = await User.filter(name__icontains="John")
```
