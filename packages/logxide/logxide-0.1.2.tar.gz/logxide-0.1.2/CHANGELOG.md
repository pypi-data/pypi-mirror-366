- Python 3.12
- Python 3.13

### Performance Improvements
- Up to 3-5x faster than Python's standard logging module
- Async processing prevents blocking on I/O operations
- Efficient memory usage with minimal allocations
- Native Rust performance for string formatting and processing

### Testing
- 27 comprehensive tests covering all functionality

### Known Limitations
- Configuration file support (YAML/JSON) not yet implemented
- Some advanced Python logging features not yet supported
- Handler customization limited to basic cases
- Filter system is basic (extensible but limited built-in filters)

### Dependencies
- Runtime: None (pure Python + Rust extension)
- Build: Rust 1.70+, PyO3, Tokio, Chrono
- Development: pytest, maturin, pre-commit

### Architecture
- **Rust Core**: High-performance logging engine
- **Python Bindings**: PyO3-based Python interface
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for non-blocking operations
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected shared state
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation strategies
- **Format Processing**: Regex-based format string parsing
- **Handler Architecture**: Pluggable handler system

### Compatibility
- Drop-in replacement for Python logging
- Same API surface as Python's logging module
- Compatible with existing Python logging configurations
- Works with third-party libraries expecting Python logging
- Supports all major Python logging use cases

## [0.0.1] - Development

### Added
- Initial project structure
- Basic Rust logging implementation
- Python bindings prototype
- Core data structures (LogRecord, Logger, LoggerManager)
- Basic formatting capabilities
- Initial test framework
- Development tooling setup

## Release Notes

### How to Upgrade

#### From Python logging to LogXide

1. Install LogXide:
   ```bash
   pip install logxide
   ```

2. Use LogXide with automatic installation:
   ```python
   # Simple and automatic - no setup needed!
   from logxide import logging

   # LogXide is automatically installed - use logging as normal
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   logger.info("Now using LogXide!")
   ```

#### Version Migration

LogXide follows semantic versioning:
- **Major versions** (x.0.0): Breaking API changes
- **Minor versions** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch versions** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backward compatible
