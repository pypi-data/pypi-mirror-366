"""
Here it is the shortcode parser, the code that
registers the different shortcode tags to find
in a given text and the handler methods to
extract the attributes of those shortcodes and
anything else that has been programmed to do
with them.

The parser registers the shortcode tags you
provide, detects those tags, extract the
information of them, minimizes the shortcodes,
gets the positions in which they are placed and,
finally, remove them to clean and leave the text
only with no shortcodes.

Any unregistered shortcode is unaccepted.

        This process involves 2 main steps:
        1. Creating shortcode instances from shortcode
        tags found in text and simplified.
        2. Obtain shortcode positions from simplified
        shortcode tags and clean the text.

        First, we parse the text with the shortcode tags
        we have registered on this parser. When they are
        detected, each shortcode tag handler (that has 
        been registered in the parser to handle its
        corresponding shortcode tag) extracts the 
        attributes (and the content if existing) and 
        appends a new shortcode to the list of shortcodes
        found, with all those attributes. In this step,
        the text is simplified so the shortcode tags are
        reduced to only their names. For example,
        [tag attribute=value] turns into [tag].

        Once we've detected the shortcodes, added them
        and simplified the shortcode tags, we iterate
        over all the shortcodes found to obtain its 
        corresponding simplified shortcode tag in the 
        text, so we can get the previous words positions.
        We update the shortcodes found with those 
        positions and we clear the shortcode tags from
        the text.
