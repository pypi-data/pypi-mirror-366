Integration Test: MCP Tool Flow

Tests MCP tool integration using real logic where possible, with heavy mocking at the subprocess/network boundary.

Scenario:
- Mocks MCPServerStdio.client_streams to simulate a successful connection.
- Calls get_mcp_servers and checks that a server is returned and can be used.

If the MCP client logic is not available, this test serves as a placeholder.

"""
Notes:
- This test mocks the MCP server's client_streams to avoid real subprocess/network calls.
- If MCP configuration is not present, the test still validates the integration boundary.
- For real MCP integration, provide a test MCP server binary and configuration.
