Integration Test: Full Session Flow

Simulates a user starting the REPL, entering commands/messages, using a tool, and exiting.

- Patches multiline_input to simulate user input.
- Mocks LLM calls at the agent boundary.
- Uses real REPL and state manager logic.

"""
Notes:
- This test uses monkeypatch (pytest fixture) to patch async functions.
- LLM calls are mocked at the agent boundary.
- The test focuses on the integration of REPL, command handling, and tool invocation.
- Real tool execution can be tested in other integration tests.
