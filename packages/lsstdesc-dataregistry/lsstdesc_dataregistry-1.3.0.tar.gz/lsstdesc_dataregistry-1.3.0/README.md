**The ``dataregistry`` is currently undergoing beta testing, if you would like to participate please get in touch!**

### What is the data registry?

The data registry is a facility to store and share datasets from DESC related projects and pipelines.

The data, once registered, are transferred and stored at a central location at NERSC, which can then be later accessed and queried using the ``dataregistry`` Python package, or the CLI. 

### Documentation
