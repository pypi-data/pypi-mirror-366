# 🐣 alpha-chick
A lightweight, high-performance technical analysis library for Python. Go find your alpha!

## Core Philosophy
alpha-chick is built for one thing: calculating technical indicators as fast as possible. Our approach is simple:

- ⚡ **Fast & Focused**: All indicators are fully vectorized (whenever possible) using pandas and NumPy to deliver high performance.

- 🎯 **Indicators Only**: This library is intentionally lightweight. We focus exclusively on calculations. No charting, no backtesting, no data fetching. Just pure, fast indicators.

- 🐼 **Pandas Native**: We use pandas Series for inputs and outputs, making integration with your existing data analysis workflow seamless.

## 🚧 Project Status
**This Chick is Still Hatching!**

`alpha-chick` is currently under active development!

I am in the early stages of building out the core indicators and refining the API. Feel free to use it and explore, but be aware that breaking changes may occur as I grow the project. There's no rush, I'm not counting our chickens before they hatch.


## 🤝 Contributing
**Don't be chicken, contribute!**

I welcome any and all contributions!

Seriously, this is an easy-going project, perfect for first-time contributors or seasoned developers. Whether you want to add a new indicator, improve the documentation, or fix a bug, your help is valued.

Feel free to open an issue to discuss a new feature or just submit a pull request. I'll work with you to get it merged.
