An easy-to-use python library for the [ntfy notification service](https://ntfy.sh/). Aiming for full feature support and a super easy to use interface.

## Quickstart

1. Install using pip with `pip3 install python-ntfy`
2. Use the `NtfyClient` to send messages:

```python
# Import the ntfy client
from python_ntfy import NtfyClient

# Create an `NtfyClient` instance with a topic
client = NtfyClient(topic="Your topic")

# Send a message
client.send("Your message here")
```

For information on setting up authentication, see the [quickstart guide](https://matthewcane.github.io/python-ntfy/quickstart/).

## Contributing

This project uses:

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as its dependency manager
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a task runner
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for running checks before each commit
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for running tests

These need to be installed separately to run the tasks.

To see all available tasks, run `just`.

Some useful tasks are:

- `just install` - Install dependencies (including dev dependencies)
- `just test` - Run all tests and checks
- `just check` - Run code quality checks (ruff + mypy)
- `just format` - Format code with ruff
- `just serve-docs` - Build and serve the docs locally

### Tests

This project is aiming for 95% code coverage. Any added features must include comprehensive tests.
