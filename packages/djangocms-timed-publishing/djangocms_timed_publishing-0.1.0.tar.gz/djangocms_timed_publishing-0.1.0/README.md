# djangocms-timed-publishing
django CMS Timed Publishing extends django CMS Versioning to allow for planned or limited publication of content:

* New option to publish from the versioning menu (The "Publish" button does not change behavior.)

* The menu brings up a modal allowing to select time limits for the visibility of the to-be-published version:

  Technically, the time limits do not affect the published status but only the visibility. This means, dates on published versions cannot be changed any more. You need to create a new draft and publish that to make a change.

* Versioning menu shows pending or expired visibility dates. "pending" is a word for a published version that is
  not yet visible. "expired" is a word for a published version not visible any more:

* "View published" button for PageContents is only offered for pages which are currently visible
  (since otherwise they'll show a 404)

* Pending or expired aliases render empty.
