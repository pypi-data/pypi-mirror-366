# Documentation Migration Summary

## 🎉 Successfully Migrated to Mike Versioning!

Your BumpCalVer documentation has been successfully migrated to use Mike for versioned documentation deployment. Here's what has been accomplished:

### 📊 Current Version Structure

Your documentation now has **1 version** available:

1. **2025.4.12.1** - Your last released version (migrated from legacy docs) [latest, stable]

All test versions have been cleaned up, leaving only your legitimate release.

### 🔗 Access Your Documentation

**Main URL:** https://devsetgo.github.io/bumpcalver/

The version selector dropdown is located in the header navigation, allowing users to switch between versions easily.

### 🛠️ Available Commands

#### Local Development
```bash
# Deploy current version locally (no push)
make create-docs-local

# Deploy as development version
make create-docs-dev

# Serve documentation locally on port 8001
make serve-docs

# List all deployed versions
make list-docs
```

#### Direct Script Usage
```bash
# Deploy specific version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --version 2025.08.02 --push

# Deploy with aliases
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --version 2025.08.02 --aliases latest stable --push

# Deploy development version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py deploy --dev --version dev --push

# List versions
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py list

# Delete a version
python3 scripts/deploy_docs.py delete --version 2025.07.01
```

### 🚀 Automated Deployment

#### GitHub Actions Integration

**Development Branches** (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`):
- `dev` branch → deploys as "dev" version
- `main`/`master` branch → deploys as "latest" version

**Release Deployment** (`.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml`):
- When you create a GitHub release → automatically publishes to PyPI + deploys versioned documentation
- Documentation version will match the PyPI package version exactly

### 📁 Files Modified

1. **`mkdocs.yml`** - Enhanced with mike plugin and version selector
2. **`scripts/deploy_docs.py`** - Comprehensive deployment script
3. **`scripts/migrate_legacy_docs.py`** - Migration script (one-time use)
4. **`makefile`** - Updated with mike-based commands
5. **`.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml`** - PyPI + documentation deployment
6. **`.github/workflows/docs.yml`** - Development documentation workflow

### ✅ Migration Results

**✅ Legacy Documentation Preserved**
- Your existing documentation from version 2025.4.12.1 has been preserved
- All content migrated to proper mike structure
- Root directory cleaned of mixed legacy content

**✅ Version Selector Enabled**
- Dropdown appears in navigation header
- Users can easily switch between versions
- Material theme integration working properly

**✅ Automated Deployment Ready**
- GitHub Actions workflows configured
- PyPI releases automatically deploy matching documentation versions
- Development branches deploy to appropriate version slots

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the system**: Visit https://devsetgo.github.io/bumpcalver/ and try the version selector
2. **Create a release**: When ready, create a GitHub release to test the full PyPI + documentation deployment
3. **Update your README**: Consider adding a link to the versioned documentation

### 🔄 Workflow for Future Releases

1. **Development**: Work on `dev` branch → documentation automatically deploys as "dev" version
2. **Release**: Create GitHub release → triggers both PyPI publishing and documentation deployment
3. **Version Management**: Documentation versions automatically match PyPI releases

Your documentation versioning system is now fully operational! 🎊
