[CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) is a python API to connect to various car services. If you want to store the data collected from your vehicle to a relational database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) this plugin will help you.

### Install using PIP
If you want to use the CarConnectivity Plugin for Databases, the easiest way is to obtain it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/carconnectivity-plugin-database/). Just install it using:
```bash
pip3 install carconnectivity-plugin-database

after you installed CarConnectivity

## Configuration
In your carconnectivity.json configuration add a section for the database plugin like this. A documentation of all possible config options can be found [here](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity-plugin-database/tree/main/doc/Config.md).

                "type": "database",
                "config": {
                    "db_url": "sqlite:///carconnectivity.db"
                }
