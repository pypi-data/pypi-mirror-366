"""
Bond detection parameters and constants.

This module provides constants for bond detection algorithms including
distance thresholds, quality assessment parameters, and validation rules.
"""

# This module previously contained extensive bond detection parameters and constants.
# These have been removed as they were unused throughout the codebase.
# The actual bond detection uses hardcoded values in the bond detection modules.
