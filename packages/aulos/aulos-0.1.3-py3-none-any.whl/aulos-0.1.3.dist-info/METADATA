## Features ‚ú®

- Comprehensive tools for audio processing and analysis based on music theory principles.
- A structured framework for organizing and working with music theory objects.
- Flexible and extensible design, allowing seamless customization and expansion.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Install the package using pip:
```
pip install aulos
```

## Usage üìñ

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Note, PitchClass

print(Note("C#4"))
# stdout:
# <Note: C#4, scale: None>

print(PitchClass("C#"))
# stdout:
# <PitchClass: C#, scale: None>
```

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Key
from aulos.TET12 import Major, Dorian, Pentatonic

print(Major(Key("C")))
# stdout:
# <Major: <Key: C>>

print(Dorian(Key("C")).components)
# stdout:
# (<PitchClass: C, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: D, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: Eb, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: F, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: G, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: A, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: Bb, scale: <Dorian: <Key: C>>>)

print(Pentatonic(Key("C")).components)
# stdout:
# (<PitchClass: C, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: D, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: E, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: G, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>,
#  <PitchClass: A, scale: <Pentatonic: <Key: C>>>)
```

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Chord
from aulos.TET12 import Major

print(Chord("C").components)
# stdout:
# (<Note: ['Dbb4', 'C4', 'B#3', 'A###3'], scale: None>,
#  <Note: ['Gbbb4', 'Fb4', 'E4', 'D##4'], scale: None>,
#  <Note: ['Abb4', 'G4', 'F##4', 'E###4'], scale: None>)

print(Chord("CM7", scale=Major("C")).components)
# stdout:
# (<Note: C4, scale: <Major: <Key: C>>>,
#  <Note: E4, scale: <Major: <Key: C>>>,
#  <Note: G4, scale: <Major: <Key: C>>>,
#  <Note: B4, scale: <Major: <Key: C>>>)
```

```python
from aulos.TET12 import Note
from aulos.TET12 import JustIntonationTuner, Equal12Tuner

print(Note("C4", tuner=Equal12Tuner(440)).hz)
# stdout:
# 440.0

print(Note("A4", tuner=JustIntonationTuner(440)).hz)
# stdout:
# 733.3333333333333
```
