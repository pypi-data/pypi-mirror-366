    This example makes use the [geodatasets](https://geodatasets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) python package to access some spatial data easily.

    Calling `geodatasets.get_path()` will download data the specified data to the machine and return the path to the downloaded file.  If the file has already been downloaded it will simply return the path to the file. 
    [See downloading and caching](https://geodatasets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#downloading-and-caching) for further details.
