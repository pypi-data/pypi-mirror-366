Create a comprehensive Python SDK for MOA (Memory Of Agents) API that provides:
- Easy initialization with environment support (alpha, beta, production)
- API versioning support
- Type hints and modern Python features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Building and publishing to PyPI

## API Endpoints to Implement
Based on the OpenAPI spec:

### Memory Operations
- [x] POST /api/v1/memories - Create memory
- [x] GET /api/v1/memories/search - Search memories
- [x] GET /api/v1/memories/analytics - Get analytics
- [x] GET /api/v1/memories/{memory_id} - Get memory by ID
- [x] PUT /api/v1/memories/{memory_id} - Update memory
- [x] DELETE /api/v1/memories/{memory_id} - Delete memory

### Graph Search Operations
- [x] POST /api/v1/graph-search - Graph search
- [x] GET /api/v1/graph-search/types - Get search types

### Relationship Operations
- [x] POST /api/v1/relationships/generate - Generate relationships
- [x] GET /api/v1/relationships/stats - Get relationship stats
- [x] DELETE /api/v1/relationships/cleanup - Cleanup relationships

### Health Operations
- [x] GET / - Root
- [x] GET /health - Health check

## Features to Implement

### Core Features
- [x] Environment configuration (alpha, beta, production)
- [x] API versioning support
- [x] Authentication with API keys
- [x] Request/response models with Pydantic
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Async support
- [x] Retry mechanisms
- [x] Rate limiting handling

### SDK Features
- [x] Type hints throughout
- [x] Docstrings and documentation
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests

- [x] CI/CD pipeline
- [x] PyPI publishing workflow

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create project structure
- ✅ Setup pyproject.toml with proper metadata and dependencies
- ✅ Configure development dependencies (pytest, black, ruff, mypy)
- ✅ Setup testing framework with coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Configuration and environment management (alpha, beta, production)
- ✅ Base client class with context manager support
- ✅ HTTP utilities with retry logic and comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Pydantic models for all API objects with proper validation

### Phase 3: API Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Memory operations API (CRUD, search, analytics)
- ✅ Graph search API with multiple algorithms
- ✅ Relationships API (generation, stats, cleanup)
- ✅ Health check and utility endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Unit tests for core components
- ✅ Configuration and validation tests
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with examples
- ✅ README with detailed usage instructions
- ✅ Example scripts (basic usage, graph search)

### Phase 5: Publishing Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ PyPI publishing configuration with automated releases
- ✅ Version management and semantic versioning
- ✅ Build system configuration with hatchling
- ✅ Publishing guide and documentation

### Phase 6: Final Verification ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Package builds successfully (`python -m build`)
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Basic import and initialization tests pass
- ✅ Ready for PyPI publication

## Build and Installation Verification

The SDK has been successfully built and tested:

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Build package
python -m build

# Test import
python -c "from memofai import MOAClient, Environment; print('Success!')"
```

## Publishing Status

The SDK is ready for publication to PyPI:
- ✅ Package structure follows Python standards
- ✅ Dependencies properly specified
- ✅ Version management configured
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline ready
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Examples provided

To publish:
1. Set up PyPI account and API token
2. Run: `twine upload dist/*`
3. Or create GitHub release for automated publishing

## Environment Configuration
The SDK will support multiple environments:
- `alpha`: https://api.alpha.memof.ai
- `beta`: https://api.beta.memof.ai (default from spec)
- `production`: https://api.memof.ai

## Version Support
- API versioning through URL path: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`, etc.
- SDK versioning following semantic versioning
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Dependencies
- `httpx` - Modern HTTP client with async support
- `pydantic` - Data validation and settings management
- `typing-extensions` - Enhanced type hints
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

## Development Dependencies
- `pytest` - Testing framework
- `pytest-asyncio` - Async testing support
- `pytest-cov` - Coverage reporting
- `black` - Code formatting
- `ruff` - Linting
- `mypy` - Type checking
