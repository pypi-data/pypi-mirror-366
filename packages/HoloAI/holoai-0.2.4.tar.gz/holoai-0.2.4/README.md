## Why HoloAI?

Most LLM wrappers lock you into a single vendor or force you to juggle multiple APIs and formats.
**HoloAI** delivers:

* **One Framework, any provider.**
* **No boilerplate, no rewrites.**
* **Plug-and-play for agents, scripts, automations, or apps.**

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`
* `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Only providers with keys set will be loaded.
