# xno_vn - The XNO-powered Quant Trading Toolkit built on Practical Wisdom.

---

**`xno_vn`** is a Python SDK designed for quant traders and researchers to **build, test, and deploy** trading strategies using data and infrastructure from the **XNO platform**. It bridges raw market data, alpha generation models, technical indicators, backtesting engines, and execution logic — all grounded in *phronesis* (Greek: φρόνησις), meaning **practical wisdom** — the art of applying knowledge effectively in real-world decisions.

## 🔧 Features

### A. 📊 Data Integration (via XNO)
| Data Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Historical OHLCV data | Candlestick data with multiple timeframes |
| Bid/Ask order book snapshots | Timestamped order book data capturing full bid-ask depth |
| Tick-level & matching engine data | Raw trades, quote changes, market events |
| Foreign trading activity | Buy/sell activity from foreign investors |
| Historical access (Pro) | Time-series access across all data types |
| Volume profile analytics (Pro) | Price-volume concentration by levels |
| Financial statements & reporting (Pro) | Balance sheet, income, cash flow |
| Macroeconomic data (Pro) | Interest rates, inflation, GDP, etc. |

### B. ⏱️ Time Series Utilities
- Technical indicators (e.g. RSI, MACD, VWMA, Ichimoku, OBV)
- Rolling windows (mean, std, z-score, min/max)
- Rolling rank, correlation, volatility
- Time alignment, forward/backward shifting
- Smart Money Concepts (CHoCH, BOS, FVG, Order Blocks)

### C. 🧪 Backtesting Engine
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Simulate strategies on historical data
- **Performance Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, alpha/beta, Sortino, Calmar, etc.
- **Execution Simulation**: Slippage, spread, latency, commissions, position tracking
- **Portfolio-level backtests**: Multiple symbols with capital allocation

### D. 📈 Alpha Generation
- **Signal Generation**: Create buy/sell signals using indicators, patterns, or ML models
- **Model Training**: Train ML models on historical data
- **Feature Engineering**: Build custom features from raw or derived inputs (e.g. momentum, mean reversion)

### E. 🚀 Execution Engine
- **Paper & Live Trading**: Use the same logic for backtest, simulation, and live
- **Pluggable Broker API**: Connect to brokers like DNSE, VPS, VNDirect, or custom gateways

### F. 📦 Modular Architecture
- `xno.data`: Data connectors and pipelines
- `xno.report`: Reporting tools and metrics
- `xno.timeseries`: Time series utilities and indicators
- `xno.xno`: Direct integration with XNO platform

## 🧪 Quick Start

```bash
pip install xno_vn
````

```python
from xno import OHLCHandler
from xno import settings
import time

# settings.api_key = 'your_api_key_here'  # Or load from environment variable XNO_API_KEY

data_handler = OHLCHandler([
    'VN30F1M', 'VN30F2M'
], resolution='m')
data_handler.load_data(from_time='2025-07-01', to_time='2025-12-31').stream()
print(data_handler.get_datas())
#
while True:
    print("Current DataFrame:")
    print(data_handler.get_datas())
    print("Data for VN30F1M:")
    print(data_handler.get_data('VN30F1M'))
    time.sleep(20)
```
