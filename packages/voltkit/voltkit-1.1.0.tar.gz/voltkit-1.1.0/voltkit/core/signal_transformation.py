    Adds harmonic components to an existing signal.

    This function adds sine waves at integer multiples of a base frequency to an input signal.
    The time array 't' and the base signal 'y' must be provided.

    Args:
        t (np.ndarray): The time array corresponding to the base signal.
        y (np.ndarray): The base signal to which harmonics will be added.
        freq (float): The fundamental frequency (in Hz) of the harmonics.
        harmonics_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are the harmonic numbers (e.g., 3 for the 3rd harmonic)
                               and values are their corresponding amplitudes.
                               Example: {3: 0.5, 5: 0.3} adds the 3rd and 5th harmonics.
