"""
A lightweight file system integrity monitor agent for the Matrix Swarm.

This script, 'TripwireLite', acts as a simple file integrity monitor. It uses the
'inotify' library to watch a configurable set of directories for any changes,
such as file creation, modification, or deletion. When an event is detected,
it logs the details, including the event type, the full path of the affected
file, and a timestamp. To prevent log spam, a cooldown mechanism is in place
for repeated events on the same file.
