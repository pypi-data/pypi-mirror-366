This project is useful for:

* functionality that isn't yet in the standard library
   * example: compressing and uncompressing .7z archives.
* functionality that is in the standard library, but isn't as intuitive
   * example: `files.run` is a convenient way to start a process.
* functionality for quickly writing one-off scripts
   * example: `files.writeAll` defaults to utf-8 and is quick to type and read.
