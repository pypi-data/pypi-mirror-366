## Django Cap
This is a implementation of [Cap.js](https://capjs.js.org/) Server for Django, which provides challenge generation and verification for PoW (Proof of Work) captcha. See

## Usage
### Installation
To install the package, simply run:
```bash
pip install django-cap
```

If you want to use the Django Ninja integration, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install django-cap[ninja]
```

Or if you want to use the Django Rest Framework integration, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install django-cap[drf]
```

**TODO**: only ninja integration and vanilla Django Json views are implemented, DRF integration will be added in the future.

### Configuration
To use this package, you need to add `django_cap` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings file:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_cap',
    'django_cap.ninja',  # Add this if you want enable ninja integration
]
```

You need to configure the url patterns in your Django project's `urls.py` file:
```python
from django_cap.example_views import urls as example_views_urls
# import examples if you want to see them


urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("cap/", include("django_cap.urls")),
    path("cap/examples/", include("django_cap.example.urls")),, # add this if you want to see examples
    ...
]
```

You can access the api at `/cap/v1/[challenge|redeem|validate]` endpoints. This is compatible with Cap.js/widgets. If your frontend is not hosted by Django, you need to refer Cap.js documentation for the installation, and simply configure the api endpoint as following:
```html
<cap-widget id="cap" data-cap-api-endpoint="https://your-api-site/cap/v1/"></cap-widget>
```

By default, ninja doc will be avaliable at `/cap/v1/docs/` and `/cap/v1/openapi.json`. If you want to disable the ninja doc, you can disable it in your Django settings file:

```python
#django_settings.py
...
CAP_NINJA_API_ENABLE_DOCS = False
...
```

### Use with Django Templates and Forms

This package provides comprehensive Django form integration for CAP verification. You can easily add CAP verification to any Django form:

#### Basic Form Integration

1. Add `CapField` to your form:

```python
from django import forms
from django_cap.forms import CapField
class MyForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = forms.EmailField()
    # Add CapField for CAP verification
    cap_token = CapField(help_text="Please retry the verification challenge.")
```

2. In your template, render the form as usual:

```html
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.name.label_tag }} {{ form.name }}
    {{ form.email.label_tag }} {{ form.email }}
    {{ form.cap_token.label_tag }} {{ form.cap_token }}
    {% if form.cap_token.errors %}
    <div class="form-errors">
        {% for error in form.cap_token.errors %}<div class="error">{{ error }}</div>{% endfor %}
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
That's it! The `CapField` will automatically handle the CAP verification process, including generating the challenge and validating the response.

### Configuration Options

- `CAP_CHALLENGE_COUNT`: The number of answer required for one challenge. Default is 50.
- `CAP_CHALLENGE_SIZE`: The size of the challenge string. Default is 32.
- `CAP_CHALLENGE_DIFFICULTY`: The difficulty of the challenge, Default is 4
- `CAP_CHALLENGE_EXPIRES_S`: The expiration time of the challenge in seconds. Default is 30 seconds.
- `CAP_TOKEN_EXPIRES_S`: The expiration time of the token in seconds. Default is 10 minutes.
- `CAP_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_S`: The interval for cleaning up expired challenges and tokens in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.
