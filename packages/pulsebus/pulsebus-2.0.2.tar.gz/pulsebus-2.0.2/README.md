# PulseBus
**PulseBus** is a general-purpose data communication toolkit designed for high-efficiency, low-latency pipelines.
A lightweight and memory-efficient data transfer framework with notification-based synchronization, built for producer-consumer pipelines, approximate-live-time status updates, and concurrent systems.

It provides:
- ✅ Object reuse through pooled memory
- ✅ Efficient, thread-safe queues with notification signaling
- ✅ Minimal memory overhead, designed for concurrency
- ✅ Easy integration with downloading systems, live feeds, etc.
