# zbq

A lightweight, wrapper around Google Cloud BigQuery with Polars integration. Simplifies querying and data ingestion with a unified interface, supporting read, write, insert, and delete operations on BigQuery tables.

## Features
* Transparent BigQuery client initialization with automatic project and credentials detection
* Use Polars DataFrames seamlessly for input/output
* Unified .bq() method for CRUD operations with SQL and DataFrame inputs
* Supports table creation, overwrite warnings, and write mode control
* Context manager support for client lifecycle management

## Examples:
```SQL
# BigQuery
from zbq import zclient

query = "select * from project.dataset.table"

# Read, Update, Insert, Delete
results = zclient.read(query)
zclient.update(query)
zclient.delete(query)
zclient.insert(query)

# Write data
zclient.write(
    df=df,
    full_table_path="project.dataset.table",
    write_type="truncate",
    warning=True
)

---

# Storage
from zbq import zstorage

# Downloads all .json files within the bucket to local current directory.
zstorage.download(
    bucket_name="name",
    file_extension=".json",
    local_dir="."
)
```
