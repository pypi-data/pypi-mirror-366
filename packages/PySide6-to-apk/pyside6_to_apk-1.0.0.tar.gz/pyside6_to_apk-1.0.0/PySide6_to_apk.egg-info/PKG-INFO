## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Configure Your Project

- **App Name:** Enter your application's name.
- **App Icon:** Click 📂 Browse to select an image file for your app icon.
- **Package Name:** (Android) Enter your package name (e.g., `org.example.myapp`).
- **Version:** Set your app version.
- **Project Path:** Select your PySide6 project directory.

### 2. Select Target Platforms

- Check the platforms you want to build for (🐧 Linux, 🤖 Android architectures).

### 3. (Optional) Edit Spec File

- Check "✏️ Edit Spec File manually" if you want to pause the build and edit the generated spec file before continuing.

### 4. Build

- Click **🚀 Build All Platforms** to build for all targets.
- Or click **▶️ Build Selected** to build only the checked platforms.

### 5. Monitor Progress

- View real-time logs in the build log area.
- As each build completes, a ✅ will appear next to the platform.

### 6. Pause/Resume for Spec Editing

- If you checked "Edit Spec File manually", the build will pause after generating the spec file.
- Edit the spec file in your project directory.
- Click **▶️ Continue** to resume the build.

### 7. Cancel or Clear

- Click **❌ Cancel All** to stop all running builds.
- Click **🧹 Clear Log** to clear the build log area.

---

## 📂 Output

- Linux executables and Android APKs are placed in a `dist/` folder inside your project directory.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The tool uses PyInstaller for Linux and `pyside6-android-deploy` for Android.
- For Android, the first build will download and set up the NDK, SDK, and wheels automatically.
- If you encounter permission issues, run the tool with appropriate permissions or adjust your project directory.

---

## 💡 Troubleshooting

- **No spec file to edit?**  
  You must start a build with "Edit Spec File manually" checked for the pause/edit/resume workflow to work.
- **Build fails or hangs?**  
  Check the build log for errors. Ensure all dependencies are installed and your environment is set up for Android builds.
- **No hover effect on Cancel button?**  
  Remove any custom/empty stylesheet from the button to inherit the global style.
