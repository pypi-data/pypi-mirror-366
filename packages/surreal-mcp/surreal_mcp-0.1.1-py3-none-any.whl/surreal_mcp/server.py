    Insert multiple records into a table in a single operation.
    
    This tool is optimized for bulk inserts when you need to create many records at once.
    It's more efficient than calling 'create' multiple times. Each record will get:
    - An auto-generated unique ID
    - Automatic created/updated timestamps
    - Schema validation (if defined)
