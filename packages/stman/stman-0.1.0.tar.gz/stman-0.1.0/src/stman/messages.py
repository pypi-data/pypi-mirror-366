Notes:
- Run this program as an admin to minimize permission errors.
- A folder size in green indicates that it could only be partially calculated.
- A folder size of "X" means that it couldn't be calculated at all.
- Avoid using this tool on system folders; they're largely inaccessible.

Type "help" in the console for help.'''
