"""Core library functions for augint-library.

in other Python code. These functions are wrapped by the CLI but can also
be used directly as a library.

    This is the main library function that can be imported and used
    in other Python code.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet.

    """Fetch data from a remote endpoint (simulated).

    This function simulates an external API call that might fail transiently.
    It's designed to demonstrate when retry and circuit breaker patterns are useful.

    In a real application, this would make an actual HTTP request to an external service.
    The simulation allows us to control failure rates for testing and demonstration.

    Args:
        endpoint: The API endpoint to fetch from.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for response (seconds).
        failure_rate: Probability of failure (0.0-1.0) for simulation.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the fetched data.

    Raises:
        NetworkTimeoutError: If the request times out.
        NetworkError: If the network request fails.

    Example:
        >>> # This might fail transiently
        >>> data = fetch_data("/api/users")
        >>> print(data["status"])
        ok
