# [turnstile_solver](https://github.com/hasnainshahidx/turnstile_solver)

**Click and solve Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA — supports both headless and GUI modes.**

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Supports **embedded** and **challenge page** Turnstile variants  
- ✅ Uses **Chrome DevTools Protocol** for DOM access and interaction  
- ✅ Human-like mouse movement using CDP or **PyAutoGUI**  
- ✅ Works in both **headless** and **visible** Chrome modes  
- ✅ Uses template-based **image matching** to locate the checkbox  
- ✅ Optional verification detection via **MutationObserver**

## 🚀 Usage Example

### ✅ Option 1: One-shot `solve()` function

Use this when you want a simple, one-time solve without worrying about managing state.

```python
from seleniumbase import Driver
from turnstile_solver import solve

driver = Driver(uc=True, headless=True)
driver.get("https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in")

success = solve(
    driver,
    detect_timeout=5,
    solve_timeout=30,
    interval=1,
    verify=True,
    click_method="cdp",  # or "pyautogui" for GUI mode only
    theme="auto",        # or "dark" / "light"
    grayscale=False,
    thresh=0.8,
    enable_logging=True
)

print("Solved:", success)
```

---

### ✅ Option 2: Reusable `Solver` class

Use this when solving Turnstile multiple times or when you want better performance and state control.

```python
from seleniumbase import Driver
from turnstile_solver import Solver

driver = Driver(uc=True, headless=True)
driver.get("https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in")

solver = Solver(
    driver,
    enable_logging=True,
    theme="auto",
    grayscale=False,
    thresh=0.8,
    click_method="cdp"
)

while True
  if solver.detect(timeout=5, interval=1):
      solved = solver.solve(timeout=30, interval=1, verify=True)
      print("Solved:", solved)
  else:
      print("Turnstile not detected")

solver.cleanup() # clean
```

### 🔍 Parameter Reference

| Parameter         | Type                                | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `driver`          | `WebDriver`                         | Selenium driver (must be on a page with Turnstile). |
| `detect_timeout` / `solve_timeout` / `timeout` | `int`  | Max time (in seconds) to try detecting or solving. |
| `interval`        | `float`                             | Delay between retries (in seconds). Default: `1.0` |
| `verify`          | `bool`                              | If `True`, waits for verification. Otherwise just clicks. |
| `click_method`    | `"cdp"` \\| `"pyautogui"`            | `'cdp'` (works in headless) or `'pyautogui'` (GUI only). |
| `theme`           | `"auto"` \\| `"dark"` \\| `"light"`   | Match Turnstile theme for template matching. |
| `grayscale`       | `bool`                              | Use grayscale for matching (faster). |
| `thresh`          | `float`                             | Confidence threshold (0-1). Default: `0.8` |
| `enable_logging`  | `bool`                              | Print debug logs to console. |

### 🔁 Which One Should I Use?

| Scenario                             | Use               |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Quick one-time solve                 | `solve()`         |
| Multiple Turnstiles on same session  | `Solver` class    |
| Full control / performance tuning    | `Solver` class    |
| Script or CLI use                    | `solve()`         |

## Limitations

While this library is designed to work in both **headless** and **GUI** modes, it's important to understand the difference in trust levels between click methods:

- **CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)** clicks are faster and work in headless mode, but they are generally **less trusted** by Cloudflare.
- **PyAutoGUI** simulates **real human mouse movements**, making clicks more realistic and harder to detect, **but it only works in GUI mode**.

**However**, if you're using a **clean IP address** and a **well-spoofed browser environment**, CDP clicks may still be sufficient to pass the challenge with a low risk score.

For better results and stronger browser spoofing, consider using **[SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase)** instead of undetectable-chromedriver. It offers more advanced stealth capabilities out of the box.
