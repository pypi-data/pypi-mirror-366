## Release

- [Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/icloudpd-web/)
- [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/spicadust/icloudpd-web)

## Overview

- **Warning**: This is a public software from personal project that comes without any warranties. You may use it for personal usages at your own risk. You can contribute to the project by submitting a feature request or a bug report via Github issues.
- [icloud-photos-downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader) is a CLI tool for downloading iCloud photos and videos.
- `icloudpd-web` is an application that provides a web UI wrapper around the icloudpd Python library.
- The application allows managing multiple icloudpd settings ("policies" in `icloupd-web`) through the web UI and monitoring the progress of the downloads.
- The application bundles a static next.js application in a fastapi server. Therefore, you can spin up the server and use the web UI using the python distribution.

- Work with policies that are ready.
- Monitor the status of a policies for download progress through logs.

### Details

- The user can add, edit, duplicate, delete, start and stop a policy.
- Download progress of a policy can be viewed through the logs that can be downloaded when policy is not running.
- On the Web UI, the user can upload a toml file to replace the currently loaded policies or download the currently loaded policies as a toml file.
- The user can update the server settings or reset the server password through the settings page.
- Refer to the [example_policy/example.toml](example_policy/example.toml) for the policy format.
- Refer to the [icloudpd docs](https://icloud-photos-downloader.github.io/icloud_photos_downloader/) for the policy options. Note that even though this app is built on top of icloudpd, the policy options are not exactly the same. More detailed documentation on this will be provided in the future.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- [ Next.js web ] <--Websocket--> [ FastAPI server ] <--wrapper--> [ icloudpd Python code ]
- The next.js application provides a web UI and the python server handles the logic and interaction with icloudpd.
- The user can manage the policy states on the web UI.
- The server stores policy specs in toml files at designated path as well upon changes.
