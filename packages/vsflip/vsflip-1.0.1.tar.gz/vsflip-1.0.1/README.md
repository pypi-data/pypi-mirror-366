# vsflip

**vsflip** is a Python wrapper for **VapourSynt** that enables perceptual video comparison using the [FLIP metric](https://github.com/NVlabs/flip) (Fidelity Loss Image Processing). It computes frame-by-frame error maps that quantify visual differences between a reference and a test video.

This wrapper integrates the `flip` Python library and works entirely within VapourSynth pipelines.

## üì¶ Features

- Frame-by-frame FLIP comparison between two `VideoNode`.
- Outputs GrayscaleS error maps where darker pixels indicate better perceptual similarity.
- Supports both `LDR` and `HDR` evaluation modes ().
- Optionally exports error maps as images (`.png`).

## üõ† Requirements

- Python ‚â• 3.13
- [VapourSynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/) R71 or newer
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [flip](https://github.com/NVlabs/flip)

## üöÄ Installation

You can install `vsflip` via pip:

```bash
pip install vsflip
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Basic Usage
```python
from vsflip import vsflip_frame, vsflip_video

# Compare the first frame of two clips
result = vsflip_frame(ref_clip, test_clip)

# Compare all frames (must be aligned and same length)
result = vsflip_video(ref_clip, test_clip)
```
- Both functions return a VideoNode in grayscale (GRAYS format)

- Refer to the Python docstrings for detailed parameter descriptions and options.
