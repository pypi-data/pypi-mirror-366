## [2.0.14] - 2025-07-30

### Fixed
- Replaced brittle pattern matching with robust LLM-based language consistency validation
- Now catches pattern variations like "MyServiceImpl.java" that were evading detection
- Uses indicator counting instead of exact string matching for better coverage

### Added
- Language detection from file extensions
- Intelligent response sanitization when cross-language suggestions detected

### Improved
- More maintainable solution that adapts to LLM behavior variations
- Future-proof against new pattern evasions

## [2.0.13] - 2025-07-30

### Fixed
- Enhanced cross-language hallucination detection to prevent confusing TDD suggestions
- Python files now block Java-specific patterns (ServiceTest.java, @Test, assertEquals, etc.)
- JavaScript/TypeScript files block Java and Python patterns
- Go files block patterns from other languages

### Improved
- Better user experience by ensuring language-appropriate TDD suggestions

## [2.0.12] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- Critical TDD bypass where minimal files (e.g., main.py with just print("hello")) were miscategorized as "structural"
- Edit/MultiEdit operations now read actual file content for proper categorization
- Entry point files (main.py, app.py, etc.) always require TDD regardless of content

### Changed  
- BREAKING: Removed hybrid categorization - ALL files now go through LLM analysis
- Any LLM categorization failure now defaults to requiring TDD (fail-secure)
- Stricter LLM prompt treats ANY executable code as implementation requiring TDD

### Security
- Eliminated fast-path pattern matching that allowed TDD bypass exploits

## [1.12.4] - 2025-07-26

### Fixed
- Modified hybrid validator to show both Security and TDD reasons when both validations fail
- TDD violations are now visible even when security validation also fails
- Format: "Security: <reason> | TDD: <reason>" when both fail

### Added
- Test case to verify TDD blocking behavior for UI/dashboard file updates

## [1.12.3] - 2025-07-26

  - Added DOCUMENTATION FILES section to LLM prompt
  - Recognizes *.md, *.rst, *.txt, *.adoc and other doc formats
  - Includes README*, CHANGELOG*, LICENSE* patterns
  - Files in docs/, documentation/, doc/ directories
- Ensures documentation files are categorized as "docs" with requires_tdd: False

## [1.11.3] - 2025-07-25

### Fixed
- CLI files with `if __name__ == "__main__"` incorrectly categorized as structural, bypassing TDD validation (#53)
- Updated categorization prompt to consider file size and complexity:
  - Entry points only structural if < 20 lines with minimal logic
  - Files > 50 lines with functions/classes always categorized as implementation
  - Medium CLI files (20-50 lines) with business logic require TDD
- Added comprehensive CLI categorization tests to test suite

## [1.11.2] - 2025-07-25

### Fixed
- Pytest plugin now correctly reports collection errors (e.g., ImportError) as failing tests (#51)

## [1.11.1] - 2025-07-25

### Fixed
- Version inconsistency where `__init__.py` had version 1.10.1 while `pyproject.toml` had 1.11.0

### Added
- Explicit support for test modification during TDD Red phase (#41)
  - Tests can be refined, renamed, or replaced without violating TDD rules
  - Clear distinction between test modification (allowed) and multiple test addition (blocked)
- Three new test scenarios for test modification validation:
  - `test_update_modify_existing_test` - changing test implementation
  - `test_update_rename_test_function` - renaming test functions
  - `test_update_replace_test_with_different_one` - replacing tests
- Enhanced TDD validation prompts with "TEST EVOLUTION IN TDD" section
- Detailed documentation of practical TDD workflows in README

### Changed
