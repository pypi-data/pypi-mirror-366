name: Transportation expenses minimization model

sets:
   plants  i: [Seattle, SanDiego]
   markets j: [NewYork, Chicago, Topeka]
   
symbols:
   variables:  [x(i)(j)]
   parameters: [f, a(i), b(j), d(i)(j), cost(i)(j)]
       
equations:
    - Supply(i): sum(j, x(i)(j))
    - Demand(j): sum(i, x(i)(j))

calibration:
    f: 90
    a(i): [350, 600]

              [2.5, 1.8, 1.4]]
    cost(i)(j): f*d(i)(j)/1000 # Transport cost in 1000s of dollars per case
   
objective_function: 
   - sum(i;j, cost(i)(j)*x(i)(j)) # Total shipment cost

constraints:
   - Supply(i) < a(i)
   - Supply(i) >= 0
   - Demand(j) > b(j)
   - x(i)(j)   >= 0

labels:
    x: Shipment quantities in cases
    f: Freight in dollars per case per thousand miles
