SimulStreaming (https://github.com/ufal/SimulStreaming) is dual-licensed:

üîπ Non-Commercial Use
You may use SimulStreaming under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 if you obtain the code through the GitHub repository.  This license is free of charge and comes with no obligations for non-commercial users.

üî∏ Commercial Use
Understanding who uses SimulStreaming commercially helps us improve and
prioritize development. Therefore, we want to require registration of those who acquire a commercial licence.
We plan to make the commercial licenceses affordable to SMEs and individuals. We are considering to provide commercial licenses either for free or for symbolic one-time fee, and maybe also provide additional support. You can share your preference via the questionnaire https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/7tCxb4gJfB.
You can also leave your contact there: https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/7tCxb4gJfB to be notified when the commercial licenses become
available.
