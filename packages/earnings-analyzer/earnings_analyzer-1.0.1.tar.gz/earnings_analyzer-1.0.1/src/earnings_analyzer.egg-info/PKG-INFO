# Earnings Call Sentiment Analyzer

This Python package provides a tool to fetch company profile data, scrape the latest earnings call transcript from The Motley Fool, perform sentiment analysis, and correlate sentiment with stock performance.

## Features

- **Flexible Transcript Scraping:** Automatically finds and scrapes earnings call transcripts for a given stock ticker from `fool.com`, with options to specify a particular quarter and year or default to the latest.
- **Company Data:** Fetches company profile information (sector, industry) from the Financial Modeling Prep API.
- **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:** Uses the Google Gemini API to analyze the transcript and provide a sentiment score, confidence level, and key discussion themes.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores company profiles, earnings call details, sentiment analysis results, and stock performance data in a local SQLite database (`earnings_analyzer.db`).
- **Structured Output:** Returns a clean dictionary object containing all the fetched and analyzed data, including the earnings call date and quarter.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Includes comprehensive error handling and logging for API calls, data processing, and database operations.
