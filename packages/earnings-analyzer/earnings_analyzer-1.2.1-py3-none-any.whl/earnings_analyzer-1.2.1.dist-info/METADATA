## Installation

```bash
pip install earnings-analyzer
```

## Prerequisites

Two API keys are required:

### Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API
Provides company data and stock prices. Obtain a free API key at [financialmodelingprep.com](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/)

### Google Gemini API  
Powers AI sentiment analysis. Obtain a free API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
FMP_API_KEY=your_financial_modeling_prep_api_key_here
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

Extract sentiment from the latest earnings call in three lines:

```python
from earnings_analyzer.api import fetch_transcript, score_sentiment

# Retrieve Apple's latest earnings call transcript
transcript = fetch_transcript("AAPL")

# Perform AI sentiment analysis
sentiment = score_sentiment(transcript['transcript_text'])

print(f"Sentiment Score: {sentiment['overall_sentiment_score']}/10")
print(f"Confidence: {sentiment['confidence_level']:.0%}")
print("Key Themes:", sentiment['key_themes'])
```

**Example Output:**
```
Sentiment Score: 7.8/10
Confidence: 85%
Key Themes: ['iPhone 15 strong demand', 'Services revenue growth', 'China market recovery', 'AI integration plans']
```

### Complete Analysis

Obtain transcript, sentiment, company data, and stock performance in a single function call:

```python
from earnings_analyzer.api import analyze_earnings_call

# Comprehensive analysis for Apple's latest earnings
results = analyze_earnings_call("AAPL")

print(f"Company: {results['profile']['companyName']}")
print(f"Sentiment: {results['sentiment']['overall_sentiment_score']}/10")
if results['stock_performance']:
    print(f"1-Week Stock Performance: {results['stock_performance']['performance_1_week']:.1%}")
```

### Specific Quarter Analysis

```python
# Analyze Microsoft Q3 2024 earnings
transcript = fetch_transcript("MSFT", quarter="Q3", year=2024)
sentiment = score_sentiment(transcript['transcript_text'])
```

### Custom Prompt Analysis

Create specialized analyses with custom prompts for research purposes:

```python
# Define a custom research prompt
ai_prompt = """
Analyze this earnings call for AI-related developments.
Return JSON: {"ai_confidence": [1-10], "ai_announcements": [list]}
"""

# Apply to any transcript
sentiment = score_sentiment(transcript['transcript_text'], custom_prompt=ai_prompt)
print(f"AI Confidence: {sentiment['ai_confidence']}/10")
print("AI Announcements:", sentiment['ai_announcements'])
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from earnings_analyzer.api import batch_fetch_transcripts, batch_score_sentiment

tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"]
transcripts = batch_fetch_transcripts(tickers)
sentiments = batch_score_sentiment(transcripts)

for ticker, sentiment in zip(tickers, sentiments):
    if sentiment:
        print(f"{ticker}: {sentiment['overall_sentiment_score']}/10")
```

## Architecture: Two Analysis Approaches

### Composable Functions (In-Memory)
Designed for custom analysis pipelines, data science workflows, and scenarios where persistence is not required:

```python
from earnings_analyzer.api import (
    fetch_transcript, 
    score_sentiment, 
    fetch_company_profile,
    calculate_stock_performance
)

# Build custom analysis pipeline
transcript = fetch_transcript("NVDA")
sentiment = score_sentiment(transcript['transcript_text'])
profile = fetch_company_profile("NVDA")
performance = calculate_stock_performance("NVDA", transcript['call_date'])
```

### Database-Backed Analysis (Persistent)
Optimal for building historical datasets, tracking trends over time, and repeated analysis:

```python
from earnings_analyzer.api import EarningsAnalyzer

analyzer = EarningsAnalyzer()

# Results automatically cached for subsequent queries
results = analyzer.analyze("TSLA")

# Access historical analysis data
historical_calls = analyzer.get_existing_calls("TSLA")
print(f"Database contains {len(historical_calls)} previous analyses")

# Batch analysis with automatic caching
tech_stocks = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "AMZN"]
all_results = analyzer.batch_analyze(tech_stocks)
```

## Usage Guidelines

**Composable Functions Are Appropriate When:**
- Building custom data pipelines
- Performing one-off analysis or research
- Integrating with existing pandas/numpy workflows
- Data persistence is not required
- Maximum flexibility is essential

**Database-Backed Analysis Is Appropriate When:**
- Tracking companies across multiple quarters
- Building historical sentiment datasets
- Analyzing longitudinal trends and patterns
- Working repeatedly with the same companies
- Automatic result caching is beneficial

## Command Line Interface

```bash
# Analyze latest earnings call
earnings-analyzer --ticker AAPL

# Analyze specific quarter
earnings-analyzer --ticker MSFT --quarter Q2 --year 2024

# In-memory analysis without database storage
earnings-analyzer --ticker GOOGL --no-db --quick

# List historical analyses in database
earnings-analyzer --ticker TSLA --list-calls
```

```

### Portfolio-Level Analysis
```python
# Analyze complete portfolio
portfolio = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "NVDA", "TSLA"]
results = analyzer.batch_analyze(portfolio)

# Identify highest sentiment score
best_sentiment = max(results, key=lambda x: x['sentiment']['overall_sentiment_score'] if x else 0)
print(f"Highest sentiment: {best_sentiment['profile']['symbol']}")
```

## Important Considerations

**Sentiment Analysis Limitations**

The sentiment scores generated by this package are experimental and require validation. Earnings call sentiment may already be incorporated into stock prices by the time transcripts become publicly available. This package provides a framework for testing sentiment-performance correlations, but users should:

- Validate sentiment scores against manual analysis of sample transcripts
- Test correlations across different time windows and market conditions  
- Consider that institutional traders access earnings information in real-time during calls

This is designed as a research tool, not a trading signal generator.

**Data Usage Compliance**

This package is intended for educational and research purposes. Users are responsible for:
- Obtaining proper API keys and respecting rate limits
- Complying with data provider terms of service  
- Ensuring usage aligns with institutional and regulatory requirements

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Configuration:**
```python
from earnings_analyzer.config import set_gemini_api_key, set_fmp_api_key

# Configure keys programmatically (useful in notebooks)
set_gemini_api_key("your_key_here")
set_fmp_api_key("your_key_here")
```

**Database Location:**
```python
import os
# Specify custom database location
os.environ["EARNINGS_ANALYZER_DB"] = "/path/to/your/database.db"
```

**Common Issues:**
- **403 Errors**: Verify API keys and check rate limits
- **Transcript Not Found**: Verify ticker symbol and try alternative quarter/year
- **Import Errors**: Confirm installation with `pip install earnings-analyzer`
