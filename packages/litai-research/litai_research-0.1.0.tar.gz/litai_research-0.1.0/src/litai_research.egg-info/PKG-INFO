# LitAI

AI-powered literature review assistant that helps researchers find papers, extract key insights, and synthesize findings with proper citations.

## Overview

LitAI is a command-line tool that streamlines academic literature review by:
- Finding relevant papers through natural language search
- Extracting key claims and evidence from PDFs
- Synthesizing multiple papers to answer research questions
- Managing citations in BibTeX format

## Features

### Paper Discovery
- Search academic papers using natural language queries
- Powered by Semantic Scholar API
- View abstracts and metadata before adding to library

### Paper Management
- Build a local library of research papers
- Automatic PDF download from ArXiv
- Duplicate detection and organized storage

### AI-Powered Extraction
- Extract key claims with supporting evidence
- Automatic section references and quotes
- Cached results for instant access

### Literature Synthesis
- Generate comprehensive literature reviews
- Answer specific research questions across multiple papers
- Proper inline citations (Author et al., Year)
- Export-ready markdown format

### Natural Language Interface
- Chat-based interaction for complex queries
- Context-aware conversations about your research
- Multi-paper analysis and comparison

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- API key for OpenAI or Anthropic

### Install with pip
```bash
pip install litai
```

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/litai.git
cd litai
uv sync  # or pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## Usage

Launch the interactive interface:
```bash
litai
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Search for papers
> /find attention mechanisms for computer vision

# Add papers to your library (by search result number)
> /add 1 3 5

# List papers in your library
> /list

# Read and extract key points from a paper
> /read 1

# Generate BibTeX citation
> /cite 1

# Synthesize multiple papers
> /synthesize Compare transformer and CNN architectures

# Natural language queries
> What are the main advantages of vision transformers over CNNs?

# Clear the screen
> /clear

# Remove papers from library
> /remove 2
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Multi-paper synthesis with specific papers
> /synthesize --papers 1,3,5 How do different attention mechanisms impact performance?

# Extract key points from multiple papers at once
> /read 1 3 5

# Natural conversation mode
> Tell me about the evolution of attention mechanisms in deep learning
> Focus specifically on computer vision applications
> What papers should I read to understand this topic?
```
