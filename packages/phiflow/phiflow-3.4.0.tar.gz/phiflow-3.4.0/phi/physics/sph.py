    Build a `phi.geom.Graph` based on proximity of `nodes` and evaluates the kernel function.

    Args:
        nodes: Particles including obstacle particles as `Geometry` collection.
        kernel: Kernel function to evaluate.
        boundary: Marks ranges of nodes as boundary particles, see `phi.geom.Graph`.
        desired_neighbors: Target average number of neighbors per particle. This determines the support radius (cutoff) used.
        compute: Comma-separated `str` of kernel properties to compute on the graph edges. Can contain `'kernel'`, `'grad'`, `'laplace'`.
            If no kernel property is given, the edge values will be set to the inverse distance between nodes instead.
        format: Sparse format in which store neighborhood information. Allowed strings are `'dense', `'csr'`, `'coo'`, `'csc'`.
        search_method: Neighborhood search method, see `phi.math.pairwise_differences`.
        domain: (Optional) Specify a fixed domain size in which the centers of all nodes must be located.
            This is required for periodic domains.
        periodic: Which domain boundaries should be treated as periodic, i.e. particles on opposite sides are neighbors.
            Can be specified as a `bool` for all sides or as a vector-valued boolean `Tensor` to specify periodicity by direction.

        `phi.geom.Graph` with edge values storing the kernel values, i.e. the interaction strength between particles.
