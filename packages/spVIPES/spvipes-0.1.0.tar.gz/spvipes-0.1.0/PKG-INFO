Shared-private Variational Inference with Product of Experts and Supervision

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system.

### PyTorch installation

We strongly recommend using spVIPES with GPU acceleration. In Linux, check your NVIDIA drivers running:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

You can then install a compatible PyTorch version from https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/. For example if your CUDA drivers are version 11.3, you should install PyTorch v1.12.1 with the following command:

```bash
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

Make sure your torch installation can see your CUDA device to take full advantage of GPU acceleration by running:

```python
import torch

torch.cuda.is_available()
```

This should return `True` if everything is installed correctly.

### spVIPES installation

To install spVIPES:

1. Install the latest release of `spVIPES` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/spVIPES/>`\_:

```bash
pip install spVIPES
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nrclaudio/spVIPES.git@main
```

## Tutorials

To get started, please refer to the [basic spVIPES tutorial](docs/notebooks/Tutorial.ipynb).

## Contact

If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].
