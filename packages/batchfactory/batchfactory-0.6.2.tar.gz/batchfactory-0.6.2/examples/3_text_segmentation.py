LABEL_SEG_PROMPT = """
Please label the following text by identifying different Scenes.

A Scene is a unit of story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, structured around conflict or change. It often contains multiple beats and actions.

A Scene should be approximately 400–800 words long. Try to divide a chapter into multiple scenes.

I will provide you with a text in which each line is labeled with a number.

Your task is to output the line numbers that indicate the start of each scene, including chapter boundaries.

Note that the given text may begin in the middle of a scene, so the first line might not mark the start of a new scene.

Please output only the line numbers, separated by spaces, with no additional text or formatting.

The text is as follows:

```
{text}
```

Please provide the line numbers marking the start of each scene in the text above, separated by spaces, with no additional text or formatting.  
Your Output:
