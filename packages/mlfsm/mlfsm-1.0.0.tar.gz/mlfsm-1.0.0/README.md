This repository provides an implementation of the Freezing String Method (FSM) for double-ended transition state searches with internal coordinates interpolation with ML-based potentials.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonmarks12/ML-FSM.git
cd ML-FSM
pip install .
```
Perform a test run with default parameters and the EMT calculator:
```
python examples/fsm_example.py data/sharada/06_diels_alder/ --calculator emt
```
Note the EMT calculator should only be used for quick demonstrations/tests.

## Tutorials 

1. A Google Colab notebook example is available at:
```
examples/FSM_Colab_AIMNet2.ipynb
```
This notebook demonstrates how to run a full FSM calculation on a Diels–Alder reaction using the AIMNet2 potential.

3. Example Script

The script:
```
examples/fsm_example.py
```
is a comprehensive and flexible tool that supports most ML-FSM functionality. 

Note: Users are responsible for installing their desired quantum chemistry backend, current calculators supported in fsm_example.py are [AIMNet2](https://github.com/isayevlab/AIMNet2), [MACEOFF23](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-off), [FAIR UMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem), [TensorNet](https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net), [xTB](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb), [QChem](https://www.q-chem.com).

3. Some ML potentials do not offer a native ASE interface. To accommodate these, a minimal example of custom ```ase.Calculator``` wrappers is provided in the ```examples/``` folder. This serves as templates for integrating arbitrary NNPs with ML-FSM
