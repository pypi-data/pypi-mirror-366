"""
Assertions for working with various testing libraries. Currently we support:
- bakery (formerly known as cisc106.py and cisc108.py)

We do intend to add more support as people request. If you have a testing
library that you would like to see supported, please open an issue on GitHub!

# TODO: At least support the builtin unittest library.
