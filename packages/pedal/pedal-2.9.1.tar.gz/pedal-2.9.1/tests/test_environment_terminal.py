A TypeError occurred:

    Unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

Type errors occur when you use an operator or function on the wrong type of value. For example, using `+` to add to a list (instead of `.append`), or dividing a string by a number.

Suggestion: To fix a type error, you should trace through your code. Make sure each expression has the type you expect it to have.
