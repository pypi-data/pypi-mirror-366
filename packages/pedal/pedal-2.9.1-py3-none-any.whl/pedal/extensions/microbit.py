"""
Mock module for BBC Microbit API.

Image formats:
    list[list[int]] (or any kind of 2d sequence)
    list[list[str]]

    A single string with lines separated by colons.
    A single string with lines separated by newlines.
    A single string without separators.

    Brightness values can be integers or characters
    You can use "?" as a "don't care" symbol for string representations.
    Equivalent values:
        `0`, ` `, `_`, `â¬›`
        `9`, `*`, `â– `, `â–ˆ`, `ðŸŸ¥`, `â¬œ`, `X`, `x`

    You can also specify via a dictionary:
        Points (x, y) => Brightness value


microbit.display.scroll - in addition to capturing the screen history, also capture the message history
microbit.display.show - and in general here too, capture any strings being show so they can be queries.

assert_microbit_displayed(image)
assert_microbit_displayed(image1, image2, ...)
assert_microbit_displaying(image)

assert_microbit_printed(text)
assert_microbit_printed_contains(text)

Lingering questions:
* How do we want to simulate inputs (e.g., pins, buttons, etc.)? Some kind of Jest-like API?

```python
# Pressing the button prints its letter
assert_microbit_printed(None)
user.press_button_a()
assert_microbit_printed('a')
user.press_button_b()
assert_microbit_printed('b')

# Simulating Flappy Bit?
assert_microbit_displayed("<bits indicating the bird is initially center>")
user.tilt_up()
```

# Infinite loops

A major issue is infinite loops.
* In some places, the loops are simply triggered by keyword arguments. For example, the `microbit.display.show` function
    can take a `loop` boolean to "loop forever". They also have a `wait` keyword to block until the animation is finished.
    Otherwise the animation happens in the background (asynchronously, I assume?).
* A major pattern is to have students do all their work within a `while True:` loop, or other kind of "infinite" loop.

The async story in Skulpt is questionable. I honestly have to go research what the current state is. I mean, heck,
the async story in JavaScript is a little questionable at times. But I think there is definitely some potential here,
even if we had to do gross things like use `exec` and stuff. So executing is not off the table, I'm pretty sure.

The harder question is how we meaningfully simulate it from the instructor code. I think a lot of this will come down
to what the instructor actually wants to do.

### While->Function

A simple strategy for handling the `while True` loop pattern is for the autograder to transform all `while True` loops
into function definitions with `if` statements inside. An example:

```python
# answer.py
from microbit.display import show
counter = 0
while True:
    show(counter)
    counter += 1

# Becomes answer.py (transformed)
from microbit.display import show
counter = 0
def _microbit_main_loop():
    global counter
    if True:
        show(counter)
        counter += 1

# Then the instructor code can be free to "use" the student code however they want
# instructor.py
from pedal import *

run()
assert_microbit_displayed(None)
call('_microbit_main_loop')     # Perhaps aliased to step_student() ?
assert_microbit_displaying(1, message="The first iteration of your loop should display the number `1`!")
call('_microbit_main_loop')
assert_microbit_displaying(2)
```

This `while->function` approach has several nightmares attached:
* How do we correctly identify between the main loop and other loops? What about inner infinite loops?
    * Heuristics could go pretty far; most of the time, won't code fit a known pattern?
* What about global variables that are modified?
    * We can track global variables and inject the `global` keyword into the function
* What about errors and such in the original code?
    * Pedal already handles this with the `source` module! It can at least have an "offset" in the code. But I'm
        thinking this may also require having "skipped" lines and/or "remapped" lines. The former would let you mark
        lines as not counting towards the total, and the latter would explicitly change existing lines.
    * Unfortunately, we don't *actually* have a way to "modify" code in Pedal. But that's easily changed, I've always
        considered writing such a module. And we can dig around for a suitable existing one if we want.

Let's do a longer example where we grade the circle light game but with button presses involved. In this version,
the A button makes it run around the edge (otherwise it will just sit there). The B button ends the game.

```python
# Start off with light in topleft
run()
assert_microbit_displaying("9" + "0"*24)
# Idling for 3 ticks should do nothing
for _ in range(3):
    step()
    assert_microbit_displaying("9" + "0"*24)
# Pressing A should make it do a circle
press_a()
step(times=16+1)   # Has to run around the perimeter, or 4*4 steps, plus one in case they need the help
assert_microbit_displayed(*EDGE_STRINGS)
# Make sure it returned to the starting point
assert_microbit_displaying("9" + "0"*24)
# Pressing B should end the loop
press_b()
step()
assert_microbit_loop_ended()
```

The `step` function finds the main game loop, and executes it. That function will return whether the loop body
was actually executed. That information is also stored in such a way that the `assert_microbit_loop_ended` function
can query it.

### While->For

A somewhat related concept is the idea of transforming the `while` loop into a `for` loop (or perhaps even an
`async for` loop?). That `for` loop can have a generator with our own tooling equipped.

```python
# answer.py
from microbit.display import show
counter = 0
while True:
    show(counter)
    counter += 1

# Becomes
from microbit.display import show
counter = 0
for _microbit_time in _microbit_main_for_loop(_instructor_code):
    show(counter)
    counter += 1

# Then we have...
# instructor.py
from pedal import *

def grade_loop_iteration(student):
    assert_microbit_displaying(1)
    yield
    assert_microbit_displaying(2)

run_async(grade_loop_iteration)
```

A major advantage over the function approach is that we are no longer beholden to the scope problems of function
definitions. But does this let us achieve our goal?

```python
def run_async():
    student_code = get_program()
    exec(student_code)
```

(Experimented with this in a scratch file. The answer is that it might work for the cpython version, but is incompatible
with the current version of the Skulpt execution model, I *think* (tried it from the student side, but not the instructor).
The basic issue is that exec uses its own separate dictionary that doesn't get updated until after the execution
finishes, I believe, so there's no way to get the "in-progress" student data? Might be solveable.

But the bigger issue with what I was trying there is that the instructor ends up having to stuff all their code in
a function that uses yield quite a bit. I'm not a huge fan of forcing the instructor to think that way?

### Async API?

A more complicated idea is to have blocking API calls for the API, that yield execution back to the instructor.

```python
# answer.py
from microbit.display import show
counter = 0
while True:
    show(counter)
    counter += 1

# instructor.py

run()     # Non-blocking version that executes in a separate thread?
await shown(1)
await shown(2)
```

So that `shown` function is obviously doing some interesting stuff:

```python
def shown(value, timeout=1000):
    '''
    Args:
        timeout (int): How long to wait before giving up on the value being displayed. A message will be shown
            to the students.
    '''
```
