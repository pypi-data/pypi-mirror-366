# IAM SARIF Report

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Validate your IAM Policies and SCPs with AWS Policy Validator, and convert those results into SARIF documents for reporting.

## Use Me

To generate findings, iam-sarif-report makes AWS API requests. The AWS Principal you use must be allowed to use the `access-analyzer:ValidatePolicy` command.

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "access-analyzer:ValidatePolicy",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### GitHub Action

See the [action.yaml](action.yaml) for detailed usage information.

```yaml

  example:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      security-events: write #Â When using GitHub Advanced Security
      actions: read
      contents: read
      checks: write # When using SARIF annotator
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # setup aws access
