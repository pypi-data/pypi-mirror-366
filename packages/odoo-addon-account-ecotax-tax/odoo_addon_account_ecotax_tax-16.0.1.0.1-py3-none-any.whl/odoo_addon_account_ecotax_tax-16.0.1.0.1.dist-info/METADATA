This module allows to compute the ecotax amounts from Odoo tax mechanism.
The advantages compared to the base account_ecotax module is that it allows to : 
- Manage ecotax amount as included or excluded from the price of the product
- Isolate the amount of the ecotax in a specific accounting account (set on the  tax)

Then the ecotax amounts are not considered as turnover, which could be good or not depending on your country's legislation or accountant preferences.

Usage
=====

1. Create a tax group named **"Ecotaxes"**. The sequence must be lower than other tax groups.
   - Set the **Preceding Subtotal** field to **"Without Ecotax"**.

2. Create two taxes named **"Fixed Ecotax"** and **"Weight-Based Ecotax"**.
   - Check the **Ecotax** checkbox.
   - Set the correct Python code:

     - For the fixed ecotax:

       .. code-block:: python

          result = quantity and product.fixed_ecotax * quantity or 0.0

     - For the weight-based ecotax:

       .. code-block:: python

          result = quantity and product.weight_based_ecotax * quantity or 0.0

   - Check the **Included in Base Amount** option.
   - The sequence for Ecotax must be lower than the VAT tax.

3. For VAT taxes, check the **Base Affected by Previous Taxes?** option.

4. Add an ecotax classification via the menu **Accounting > Configuration > Taxes > Ecotax Classification**.

   - The ecotax classification can be either a fixed ecotax or a weight-based ecotax.
   - Ecotax classification information can be used for legal declarations.
   - For the fixed ecotax, the ecotax amount is used as a default value, which can be overridden on the product.
   - For the weight-based ecotax, define one ecotax by a coefficient applied to the weight (depending on the product's materials).
   - Set the appropriate tax in the **Sale Ecotax** field.

5. Assign one or more ecotax classifications to a product.

   - The ecotax amount can also be manually overridden on the product.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Since an update in Odoo https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/13e9833e0bc809a26843890363586f61a37d061c the case with ecotax as tax included and another tax included does not work anymore.
The ecotax tax should only be used along with price excluded tax, or be configured as price excluded itself.
