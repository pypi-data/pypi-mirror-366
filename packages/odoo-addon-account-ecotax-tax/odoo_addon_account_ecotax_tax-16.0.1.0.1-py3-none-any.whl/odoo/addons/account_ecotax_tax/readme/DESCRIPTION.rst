This module allows to compute the ecotax amounts from Odoo tax mechanism.
The advantages compared to the base account_ecotax module is that it allows to : 
- Manage ecotax amount as included or excluded from the price of the product
- Isolate the amount of the ecotax in a specific accounting account (set on the  tax)

Then the ecotax amounts are not considered as turnover, which could be good or not depending on your country's legislation or accountant preferences.
