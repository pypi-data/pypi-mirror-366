# PM2 Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Did

1. **Installed PM2** âœ…
   - PM2 is now globally installed on your system

2. **Fixed Configuration** âœ…
   - Updated `ecosystem.config.js` to use `python3` instead of `python`
   - Fixed the monitoring dashboard to use the correct runner script

3. **Started Monitoring Dashboard** âœ…
   - The monitoring dashboard is now running under PM2 management
   - Available at: http://localhost:8501

## Current Status

```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status
```

Currently running:
- âœ… **ansera-monitor** - Monitoring Dashboard (online)

## What's Different Now?

### In the Monitoring Dashboard:
- You'll see "ðŸš€ PM2 is managing 1 Ansera services" instead of "PM2 not available"
- You have access to PM2 control buttons:
  - **Start All** - Start all configured services
  - **Stop All** - Stop all services
  - **Restart MCP** - Restart the MCP server

### Benefits You Now Have:
1. **Auto-restart** - If the dashboard crashes, PM2 will restart it
2. **Memory management** - PM2 will restart if memory usage exceeds 500MB
3. **Centralized logs** - All logs in `logs/pm2/` directory
4. **Professional monitoring** - Use `pm2 monit` for real-time monitoring

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Start All Services:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

This will start:
- MCP Server (for Claude integration)
- Queue Processor (for document processing)
- Qdrant Monitor (health checks)

### View Logs:
```bash
# All logs
pm2 logs

# Specific service
pm2 logs ansera-monitor
```

### Save PM2 Configuration:
```bash
# Save current process list
pm2 save

# Set PM2 to start on system boot (optional)
pm2 startup
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors for other services:
- **ansera-mcp-server**: Requires MCP integration setup
- **ansera-queue-processor**: Requires queue system setup
- **ansera-qdrant-monitor**: Requires Qdrant to be running

These are optional services. The monitoring dashboard works independently!

## Quick Commands

```bash
# From the vector-db-query directory:
cd "/Users/haithamdata/Documents/Haitham Old/Npipeline/APP/Personal/Ansera/vector-db-query"

# Status
pm2 status

# Restart monitoring
pm2 restart ansera-monitor

# Stop all
pm2 stop all

# Delete all from PM2
pm2 delete all
```

Your monitoring dashboard is now professionally managed by PM2! ðŸš€
