    Computes Local Outlier Probabilities (LoOP)

    LoOP is a density-based outlier detection method that assigns an outlier probability
    to each data point, indicating how likely it is to be an outlier relative to its
    local neighborhood.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        The input dataset, expected to be a 2D tensor of shape (N, D),
        where N is the number of samples and D is the number of features.
    lambda_
        Scaling factor for the probabilistic distance (pdist) and the
        normalization factor (n_plof). A common value suggested in the
        original paper is 3.0.
    k
        The number of nearest neighbors to consider for local density estimation.
    distance_metric
        The distance metric to use for computing neighbor distances.
        Can be "l2" for Euclidean distance or "cosine" for Cosine distance.

    Returns
    -------
    A 1D tensor of shape (N,) containing the LoOP score (outlier probability)
    for each data point, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

    Notes
    -----
    The paper available at https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/LoOP1649.pdf
