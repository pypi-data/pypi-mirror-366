**`rara-meta-extractor`** is a  Python library for extracting relevant meta information for cataloging.


---

## ✨ Features  

- Extracts relevant **metainformation** for cataloging (authors, titles, publication dates, publisher, ISBN, ISSN etc).
- Detects and extracts **summaries, conclusions and abstracts**.
- Uses **Llama** for extracting metadata from plaintext and **custom parsers** for extrating metadata from **EPUB and METS/ALTO mark-ups**.
- Supports extracting **custom set of user-defined** fields.¹

¹ Might not work well with fine-tuned Llama instances.

## ⚡ Quick Start  

Get started with `rara-meta-extractor` in just a few steps:

1. **Install the Package**  
   Ensure you"re using Python 3.10 or above, then run:  
   ```bash
   pip install rara-meta-extractor
   ```

2. **Import and Use**  
   Extracting user-defined fields:

   ```python
    from rara_meta_extractor.llama_extractor import LlamaExtractor
    from pprint import pprint

    text = """

### 🔍 `MetaExtractor` Class

#### Overview

`MetaExtractor` class wraps the logic of different types of meta extractors (`EPUBMetaExtractor`, `MetsAltoMetsExtrator` and `LlamaMetaExtractor`) along with all text part classifiers (`EPUBTextPartClassifier`, `MetsAltoTextPartClassifier`, and `RegexTextPartClassifier`).

#### Importing

```python
from rara_meta_extractor.meta_extractor import MetaExtractor
```

#### Class Parameters

| Name                   | Type   | Optional | Default                                          | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------ |----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| meta_extractor_config  | dict   | True*    | rara_meta_extractor.config.META_EXTRACTOR_CONFIG | Configuration for Llama's meta extractor agent.  |
| text_classifier_config | dict   | True*    | rara_meta_extractor.config.TEXT_CLASSIFIER_CONFIG| Configuration for Llama's text classifier agent. NB! Text classifier is used only for filtering the input passed to the meta extractor agent. However, this behaviour is disabled by default. |

* Although both params have default values, it is stronly recommended to ensure that correct `llama_host_url` is used.

All possible configuration parameters are listed in the table below:

##### Configuration Parameters

The following table lists all possible configuration params for `meta_extractor_config` and `text_classifier_config`.

| Name             | Type       | Required | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------- |----------|------------------------------------------------|
| llama_host_url   |  str       | True     | Llama server URL, e.g. "http://localhost:8080" |
| instructions     |  str       | False    | Instructions for Llama.                        |
| fields           |  List[str] | False    | List of fields to extract. This is necessary to define only, if you wish to use a custom set of fields to extract opposed to the predefined ones. NB! If fields is defined, the JSON schema will be generated automatically. |
| json_schema      |  dict      | False    | JSON schema to use for generating grammars for Llama. NB! This is only necessary, if fields are not defined or you wish to use more advanced restrictions for them. The schema is not necessary for extracting default/predefined fields. Read more about the correct structure from here: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/grammars|
| temperature      |  float     | False    | Temperature in range [0, 2]. The lower the temperature, the more deterministic are the Llama outputs. By default = 0.0 |
| n_predict        |  int       | False    | Number of tokens Llama is allowed to predict. By default = 500. |

#### Key Functions

##### Function: `extract`

The main function for extracting meta information.

###### Parameters

| Name                   | Type       | Required | Default | Description    |
| ---------------------- | -----------| -------- | --------|----------------|
| texts                  | List[dict] | True     | -       | List of texts from where to extract meta information. For EPUB and METS/ALTO, expects content of `texts` from digitizer output. Otherwise, must minimally contain keys `text` and `lang`. |
| epub_metadata          | dict       | False    | {}      | Expects the content of `doc_meta.epub_metadata` from digitizer output. |
| mets_alto_metadata     | List[str]  | False    | []      | Expects the content of `doc_meta.mets_alto_metadata` from digitizer output. |
| verify_texts_with_llm  | bool       | False    | False   | If enabled, each text is passed to text classifier agent first and only texts classified as metadata blocks are passed to meta extractor(s). |
| n_trials               | int        | False    | 1       | Indicates how many trials to run for predicting metadata with LlamaExtractor for the same text. NB! Setting it higher than 1 has purpose only if temperature > 0.|
| merge_texts            | bool       | False    | True    | If enabled, texts are merged into a single text block before passing it to LlamaExtractor. Otherwise texts are passed one by one to LlamaExtractor and results are merged afterwards. |
| min_ratio              | float      | False    | 0.8     | Relevant only if n_trials > 1. Indicates the ratio of times a meta value has to be predicted during trials. E.g. if min_ratio = 0.7 and a value is predicted 2 out of 3 trials, it will not be returned as 2/3 = 0.66 < 0.7.|
| add_missing_keys       | bool       | False    | False   | If enabled, all possible meta keys are added to the output, even if the content has not been extracted. |
| detect_text_parts      | bool       | False    | True    | If enabled, runs text part detection for detecting conclusions, abstracts etc. |
| max_length_per_text    | int        | False    | 1500    | If verify_texts_with_llm is set to False, this param is used for dummy metadata detection -  if a text is longer than the threshold set with this param, it will not be included into Llama input. |
| n_first_pages          | int        | False    | 5       | How many first pages to consider for possible Llama input? NB! Not all of them are actually added to the input as the pages are passed through prefiltering. |
| n_last_pages           | int        | False    | 0       | How many last pages to consider for possible Llama input? NB! Not all of them are actually added to the input as the pages are passed through prefiltering. |
| n_strict_include       | int        | False    | 3       | Number of pages (out of n_first_pages + n_list_pages set) to pass to Llama  without additional prefiltering. |
| simple                 | bool       | False    | False   | If enabled, the outputs of titles and authors are simplified (some fields necessary mostly for constructing final MARC files are removed). |

###### Result

Function `extract` returns a dictionary with two keys:
- `extractor`- Indicates which extractor was used (possible values are: "Llama-Extractor", "EPUB-Extractor", and "METS/ALTO-Extractor")
- `meta` - Extracted metainformation formatted as dict.

##### Function: `extract_from_digitizer_output`

This function allows passing raw digitizer output to the meta extractor.
