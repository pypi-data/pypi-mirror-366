The Zen of GenAI, by Anuj Sadani

1. Clarity of intent is better than volume of output.
2. Prompt with purpose—lazy prompting leads to lazy outcome.
3. Verify relentlessly—AI can hallucinate; your tests should not.
4. Human judgment is irreplaceable.
5. Transparency is a powerful ally.
6. Readability counts, especially in generated code.
7. Refactor good ideas rather than reinventing vague ones.
8. Reuse wisdom, not just code.
9. Every suggestion deserves scrutiny—trust is earned, even by models.
10. Errors should never be silently ignored unless explicitly understood and accepted.
11. If code is hard for a human to explain, it’s a bad idea.
12. If code is easy for a human to explain, it may be a good idea.
13. In deterministic tasks, keep the temperature zero.
14. Let code be the documentation.
15. Bias compounds—challenge familiar patterns.
16. The best output is the one you truly understand.
