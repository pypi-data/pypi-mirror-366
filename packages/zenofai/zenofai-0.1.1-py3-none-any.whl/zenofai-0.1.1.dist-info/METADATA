### The Guiding Philosophy for the Age of GenAI

In the age of AI, writing Python is no longer just about what you type—it's about what you ask, verify, and improve. The `zenofai` package provides a guiding philosophy for this new era of collaboration.

By simply importing this package, you are reminded of the principles that foster thoughtful and effective human-AI partnerships, ensuring that your code remains clear, correct, and intentional.

### The Zen of GenAI, by Anuj Sadani

Just as the original Zen of Python provides a timeless guide for developers, the Zen of GenAI offers principles for the modern AI-assisted workflow.

```python
>>> import zenofai
````

The principles are:

1.  **Clarity of intent is better than volume of output.**
2.  **Prompt with purpose**—lazy prompting leads to lazy outcome.
3.  **Verify relentlessly**—AI can hallucinate; your tests should not.
4.  **Human judgment is irreplaceable.**
5.  **Transparency is a powerful ally.**
6.  **Readability counts, especially in generated code.**
7.  **Refactor good ideas rather than reinventing vague ones.**
8.  **Reuse wisdom, not just code.**
9.  **Every suggestion deserves scrutiny**—trust is earned, even by models.
10. **Errors should never be silently ignored** unless explicitly understood and accepted.
11. **If code is hard for a human to explain, it’s a bad idea.**
12. **If code is easy for a human to explain, it may be a good idea.**
13. **In deterministic tasks, keep the temperature zero.**
14. **Let code be the documentation.**
15. **Bias compounds**—challenge familiar patterns.
16. **The best output is the one you truly understand.**
