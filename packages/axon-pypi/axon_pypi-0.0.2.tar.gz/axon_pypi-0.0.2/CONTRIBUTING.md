# Contributing to Axon

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Axon** â€” a lightweight C-backed Python array manipulation library. This guide will help you get started with contributing and outlines the best practices for working on this project.

## Project Structure

```text
build/
â”‚â”€â”€ \librarry.dll
â””â”€â”€ \libarray.so       # compiled c/c++ codebase
axon/
â”œâ”€â”€ \csrc         # core c/cpp++ backend lies here
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ \core.cpp         # core functions & logics of array goes here
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ \core.h
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ \array.cpp         # array function handling file
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ \array.h
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ \shape.py     # shape/flatten utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ \_core.py         # Python array class logic
â””â”€â”€ \_cbase.py        # ctypes interface to C library
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Basic knowledge of `ctypes`, Python OOP, and C
- A working C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, or MSVC)
- Make sure you can compile and load the shared library successfully!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repo.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delveopers/Axon.git
cd axon
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Add your feature/fix in Python or the C backend
- Update or add new tests in `test.py` or `tests/`
- Run your code and verify everything works

### 5. Run the Test File

```bash
python test.py
```

If you added new features, update `test.py` to include usage examples.

## Guidelines

### Do

- Keep indentation to **2 spaces** in both Python and C files
- Use **pure C** (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`) â€” no external dependencies
- Make sure `lib.print_tensor()` works for your output
- Add examples to `test.py` if your feature is user-facing
- Write clean, readable, and consistent code

### Donâ€™t

- Donâ€™t use `numpy`, `math`, or other Python math libraries
- Donâ€™t modify the `__init__` method logic for internal tensors unless necessary
- Donâ€™t commit `.dll` / `.so` files to Git
