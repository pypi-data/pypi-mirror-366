# 📦 QBI_radon

**QBI_radon** is a Python library that provides an efficient, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable implementation of the **Radon transform** using **PyTorch ≥ 2.0**.

QBI_radon provides **GPU-accelerated forward and backward projection operations** for tomography, making it ideal for computed tomography (CT) research and development.

The Radon transform maps an image to its Radon space representation — a key operation in solving **CT reconstruction problems**. This GPU-accelerated library is designed to help researchers and developers obtain **fast and accurate tomographic reconstructions**, and seamlessly combine **deep learning** and **model-based approaches** in a unified PyTorch framework.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Differentiable Forward & Back Projections**  
  All transformations are fully compatible with PyTorch’s autograd system, allowing gradient computation via `.backward()`.

- ⚡ **Batch Processing & GPU Acceleration**  
  Designed for speed — supports batched operations and runs efficiently on GPUs. Faster than `skimage`'s Radon transform.

- 🔁 **Transparent PyTorch API**  
  Seamless integration with PyTorch pipelines. Compatible with **Nvidia AMP** for mixed-precision training and inference.

- 🧩 **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Built entirely on PyTorch ≥ 2.0, ensuring compatibility across major operating systems — Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and more.

## 🧠 Applications

- Deep learning for CT image reconstruction  
- Model-based & hybrid inverse problems  
- Differentiable physics-based layers in neural networks  
- GPU-accelerated Filtered Backprojection


## 🔧 Implemented Operations

- ✅ **Parallel Beam Projections**

Additional projection geometries and advanced features are under development. Stay tuned!
