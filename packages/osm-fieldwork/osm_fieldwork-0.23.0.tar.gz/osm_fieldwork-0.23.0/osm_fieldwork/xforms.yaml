# This section is for simple tag translation. Sometimes the value from
# the choices sheet of the XLSXForm is very close, but not an exact
# match to an approved OSM tags. Many XLSXForms that used OMK tried
# hard to use the (almost) same value as the official OSM one. This
# makes it easier to deal with older forms without having to edit the
# raw data.

# ODK allows a colon in a selection name, but does not for the
# variable name that later gets used as a tag. When using existing OSM
# data we need to handle converting the tag name back to the colon
# version for OSM.
