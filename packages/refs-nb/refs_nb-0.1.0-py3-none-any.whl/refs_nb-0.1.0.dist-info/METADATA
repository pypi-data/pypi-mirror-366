# refs_nb

ðŸ¤” Classify if a text chunk is a reference!

A fast, lightweight Naive Bayes classifier for determining whether a chunk of scientific text is a bibliographic reference or main text.

- Input: Any text chunk (sentence, paragraph, or block)
- Output: "reference" or "main_text" label, with confidence score

Ideal for preprocessing, data cleaning, or automated sectioning in scientific document analysis.
