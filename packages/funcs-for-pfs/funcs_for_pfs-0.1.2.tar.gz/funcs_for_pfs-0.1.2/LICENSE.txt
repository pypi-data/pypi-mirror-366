Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (collectively, "rights") upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain jurisdictions, however, do not automatically confer ownership of such rights upon the creator(s) of such works, thereby necessitating the use of contracts to secure them for purposes of distribution. These contracts often designate an exclusive venue for disputes, which may be located in a different jurisdiction than that of the contracting party, thereby requiring litigation in foreign courts.

This document is intended to serve as a Public Domain Dedication. The person or persons who have associated their work with this document (the "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever copyright and related or neighboring rights he recognizes in the work of authorship identified in this Public Domain Dedication to the public domain.
