**Accio** ðŸª„ - and your single-cell insights appear - Not quite but - `acia` - and your single-cell insights appear to become much easier ðŸ˜‰

The `acia` library provides utility functionality for analysing 2D+t time-lapse image sequences in microfluidic live-cell imaging experiments. It provides:
- Abstraction for various image sources (local, OMERO)
- automated image analysis for instance segmentation and tracking
- automated and unit-aware single-object property extraction.

Although the funtionality is developed with microfluidic applications in mind, the library can be used for any objects detected in images.

## Installation

Install `acia` from pypi:

```bash
pip install acia
```


## Developers

1. Clone this repository
