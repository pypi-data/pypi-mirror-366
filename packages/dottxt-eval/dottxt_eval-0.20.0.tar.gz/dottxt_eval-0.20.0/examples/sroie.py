"""Example of using the SROIE dataset for receipt information extraction evaluation.

This example requires the doteval-datasets plugin to be installed:
    pip install doteval-datasets

The SROIE dataset contains receipt images with annotations for:
- company: The business name on the receipt
- date: The transaction date
- address: The business address
- total: The total amount

Note: This example uses a placeholder function for receipt extraction.
In practice, you would use a multimodal model or OCR system.
