The Terra Classic Data Analysis Software Development Kit (SDK) not only possesses the functions of a basic SDK but also specifically enhances the on - chain historical data tracing and data analysis functions.

## Features

- **Basic SDK**: Inherit all the LCD query、Tx transaction from the basic SDK and maintain updates.

- **Data Analysis**: Enhanced the on-chain data analysis function, providing aggregation interfaces for historical data tracing and display of pre - processed results.

- **BUG Fixed**: Since validators have the greatest stake in the development of the Terra chain, they actively fix bugs and add features. Currently, the [Binodes](https://validator.info/terra-classic/terravaloper1s2xpff7mj6jpxfyhr7pe25vt8puvgj4wy0tzjx) validator is the main maintainer.

## Installation

<sub>**NOTE:** _All code starting with a `$` is meant to run on your terminal (a bash prompt). All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>._</sub>

Terra SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:

Upgrade the SDK:
```
$ pip install -U terra-classic-data-analysis-sdk
```

<sub>_You might need to run pip via ```python -m pip install -U terra-classic-data-analysis-sdk```. Additionally, you might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup._<sub>

# API Reference

An intricate reference to the APIs on the Terra SDK can be found <a href="https://terra-money.github.io/terra.py/index.html">here</a>.

<br/>

# Getting Started

A walk-through of the steps to get started with the Terra SDK alongside a few use case examples are provided below. Alternatively, a tutorial video is also available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfasBlJHKIg">here</a> as reference.

## Requirements

Terra Classic SDK requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python v3.7+</a>.


# Usage Examples

One line of code to query the maximum block height on the current blockchain：

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient

>>> LCDClient().tendermint.block_info()['block']['header']['height']
```

`'1687543'`

Notice：User-defined LCD and CHAIN are still supported, and the usage inherits from the underlying basic SDK capabilities.

### Async Usage

If you want to make asynchronous, non-blocking LCD requests, you can use AsyncLCDClient. The interface is similar to LCDClient, except the module and wallet API functions must be awaited.

```python
>>> import asyncio 
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import AsyncLCDClient

>>> async def main():
      terra = AsyncLCDClient()
      total_supply = await terra.bank.total()
      print(total_supply)
      await terra.session.close # you must close the session

>>> asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Building and Signing Transactions

If you wish to perform a state-changing operation on the Terra Classic blockchain such as sending tokens, swapping assets, withdrawing rewards, or even invoking functions on smart contracts, you must create a **transaction** and broadcast it to the network.
Terra Classic SDK provides functions that help create StdTx objects.

### Example Using a Wallet (_recommended_)

A `Wallet` allows you to create and sign a transaction in a single step by automatically fetching the latest information from the blockchain (chain ID, account number, sequence).

Use `LCDClient.wallet()` to create a Wallet from any Key instance. The Key provided should correspond to the account you intend to sign the transaction with.

<sub>**NOTE:** *If you are using MacOS and got an exception 'bad key length' from MnemonicKey, please check your python implementation. if `python3 -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"` returns LibreSSL 2.8.3, you need to reinstall python via pyenv or homebrew.*</sub>

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.key.mnemonic import MnemonicKey

# Fill in the mnemonic phrase of your wallet. A better practice is to set it as a system variable and read it.
>>> key = MnemonicKey(
    mnemonic="sport oppose usual cream task benefit canvas xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

# Init wallet
>>> wallet = LCDClient().wallet(key=key)
```

Once you have your Wallet, you can simply create a StdTx using `Wallet.create_and_sign_tx`.

```python
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.core.bank import MsgSend
>>> from terra_classic_sdk.client.lcd.api.tx import CreateTxOptions

>>>  tx = wallet.create_and_sign_tx(CreateTxOptions(
        msgs=[MsgSend(
            "terra1drs4gul908c59638gu9s88mugdnujdprjhtu7n", # Sender
            'terra1s2xpff7mj6jpxfyhr7pe25vt8puvgj4wyq8lz4', # Receiver
            "1000000uluna"  # send 1 lunc
        )],
        memo="test transaction!",
        gas_adjustment=1.2,  # Auto fee, can be increased during peak periods.
 
        # fee=Fee(240324,'7023928uluna'),  # Set the fees manually if you need
    ))
```

You should now be able to broadcast your transaction to the network.

```python
>>> result = LCDClient().tx.broadcast(tx)
>>> print(result)
```

<br/>

## Dependencies

Terra Classic SDK uses <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to manage dependencies. To get set up with all the required dependencies, run:

```
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```

## Tests

Terra Classic SDK provides extensive tests for data classes and functions. To run them, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):

```
$ make test
```

## Code Quality

Terra Classic SDK uses <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a>, <a href="https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">isort</a>, and <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Mypy</a> for checking code quality and maintaining style. To reformat, after the steps in [Dependencies](#dependencies):

```
$ make qa && make format
```

- A description of the problem / suggestion.
- How to recreate the bug.
- If relevant, including the versions of your:
  - Python interpreter
  - Terra SDK
  - Optionally of the other dependencies involved
- If possible, create a pull request with a (failing) test case demonstrating what's wrong. This makes the process for fixing bugs quicker & gets issues resolved sooner.
  </br>

## Requesting a Feature

If you wish to request the addition of a feature, please first check out the <a href="https://github.com/BInodes-official/terra.py/issues">Issues</a> page and the <a href="https://github.com/BInodes-official/terra.py/pulls">Pull requests</a> page (both Open and Closed tabs).
