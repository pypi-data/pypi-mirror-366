    Adds support for autoscaling of non-default worker node groups. The min/max
    node count properties on each node group are passed to the autoscaler to
    determine autoscaling behaviour. If the target cluster has the
    `auto_scaling_enabled` cluster label set to `true` then any node groups with
    both `min_node_count`` and `max_node_count` properties set will be allowed
    to autoscale between these min and max node counts depending on the cluster's
    current workload.
