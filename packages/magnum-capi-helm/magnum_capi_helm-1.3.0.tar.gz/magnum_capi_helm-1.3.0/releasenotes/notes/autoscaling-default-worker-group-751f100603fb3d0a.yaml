    Adds support for autoscaling of the default worker node group by respecting the
    `min_node_count` and `max_node_count` cluster labels. Unlike the Heat driver,
    when these labels are provided, the cluster will always start with node count
    equal to the minimum node count value and the alternative `node_count` flag will
    be ignored.
