    * This is the initial release of a new in-tree Magnum driver which leverages
      Helm and the Kubernetes `Cluster API <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api>`_
      project to provide an alternative to the existing Heat driver for creating
      and managing Kubernetes clusters via OpenStack Magnum.

    * This project started life as a out-of-tree driver which was developed and maintained
      at https://github.com/stackhpc/magnum-capi-helm. This 1.0.0 release marks the deprecation
      of this out-of-tree source repository and the first official release of the in-tree
      version which is under OpenStack governance, with source code now available at
      https://opendev.org/openstack/magnum-capi-helm.

    * The driver is generally ready for production use and has been deployed on a number of
      OpenStack systems prior to this first official release. However, this does not preclude
      the possibility of unforeseen issues and omissions at this early stage of the release
      cycle - bug reports welcome and appreciated!
