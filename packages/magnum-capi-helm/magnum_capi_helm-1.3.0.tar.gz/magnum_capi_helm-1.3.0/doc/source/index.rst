=======================================================
Welcome to the Magnum CAPI Helm Driver's documentation!
=======================================================

Magnum CAPI Helm is an OpenStack Magnum driver which uses Helm to create
Kubernetes (k8s) clusters with Cluster API.

The driver uses a standard set of Helm charts to create the k8s resources
required to provision and manage a k8s cluster using Cluster API,
including various useful add-ons like a CNI and a monitoring stack.

These Helm charts currently live at https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/capi-helm-charts.

The Helm charts are intended to be a way to share a reference method to
create k8s clusters on OpenStack. The charts are not expected or intended to
be specific to Magnum. The hope is they can also be used by ArgoCD, Flux or
Azimuth to create clusters outside of Magnum if desired.
