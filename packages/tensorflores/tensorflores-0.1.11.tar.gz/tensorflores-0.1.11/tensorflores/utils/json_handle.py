class JsonHandle:
    """
    A utility class for handling JSON operations related to neural network models, 
    such as converting TensorFlow models to JSON, applying int8 quantization schemes, 
    and loading/saving models as JSON files.

    This class provides methods to:
    - Convert a TensorFlow model into a structured JSON representation.
    - Modify the JSON to apply int8 quantization for weights and biases.
    - Extract parameters (weights, biases, and shapes) from a JSON model.
    - Save a JSON representation of a model to a file.
    - Load a model from a JSON file.

    It aims to facilitate easy storage and retrieval of model data in JSON format 
    and support quantization-aware tasks.
