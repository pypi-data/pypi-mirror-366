    Catalog API

    The Catalog API allows users to search for and locate an eBay catalog product that is a direct match for the product that they wish to sell. Listing against an eBay catalog product helps insure that all listings (based off of that catalog product) have complete and accurate information. In addition to helping to create high-quality listings, another benefit to the seller of using catalog information to create listings is that much of the details of the listing will be prefilled, including the listing title, the listing description, the item specifics, and a stock image for the product (if available). Sellers will not have to enter item specifics themselves, and the overall listing process is a lot faster and easier.  # noqa: E501

        This method searches for and retrieves summaries of one or more products in the eBay catalog that match the search criteria provided by a seller. The seller can use the summaries to select the product in the eBay catalog that corresponds to the item that the seller wants to offer for sale. When a corresponding product is found and adopted by the seller, eBay will use the product information to populate the item listing. The criteria supported by <b>search</b> include keywords, product categories, and category aspects. To see the full details of a selected product, use the <b>getProduct</b> call. <br /><br /> In addition to product summaries, this method can also be used to identify <i>refinements</i>, which help you to better pinpoint the product you're looking for. A refinement consists of one or more <i>aspect</i> values and a count of the number of times that each value has been used in previous eBay listings. An aspect is a property (e.g. color or size) of an eBay category, used by sellers to provide details about the items they're listing. The <b>refinement</b> container is returned when you include the <b>fieldGroups</b> query parameter in the request with a value of <code>ASPECT_REFINEMENTS</code> or <code>FULL</code>. <br /><br /> <span style=\"padding: 15px 20px; display: block; border: 1px solid #cccccc\"><b>Example</b> <br />A seller wants to find a product that is \"gray\" in color, but doesn't know what term the manufacturer uses for that color. It might be <code>Silver</code>, <code>Brushed Nickel</code>, <code>Pewter</code>, or even <code>Grey</code>. The returned <b>refinement</b> container identifies all aspects that have been used in past listings for products that match your search criteria, along with all of the values those aspects have taken, and the number of times each value was used. You can use this data to present the seller with a histogram of the values of each aspect. The seller can see which color values have been used in the past, and how frequently they have been used, and selects the most likely value or values for their product. You issue the <b>search</b> method again with those values in the <b>aspect_filter</b> parameter to narrow down the collection of products returned by the call.</span> <br /><br /> Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the <b>q</b> parameter, or the <b>category_ids</b>, <b>gtin</b>, or <b>mpn</b> parameter with a valid value.

        :param str aspect_filter: An eBay category and one or more aspects of that category, with the values that can be used to narrow down the collection of products returned by this call. <br /><br /> Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects. <br /><br /> You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this method without this parameter. It will return either the <b>productSummaries.aspects</b> container, the <b>refinement.aspectDistributions</b> container, or both, depending on the value of the <b>fieldgroups</b> parameter in the request. The <b>productSummaries.aspects</b> container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The <b>refinement.aspectDistributions</b> container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter. <br /><br /> <span class=\"tablenote\"> <strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the Taxonomy API's <b>getItemAspectsForCategory</b> method to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category. </span> <br /><br /> The syntax for the <b>aspect_filter</b> parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; <b>categoryId</b> is required): <br /><br /> <code>aspect_filter=categoryId:<i>category_id</i>,<br /> <i>aspect1</i>:{<i>valueA</i>|<i>valueB</i>|...},<br /> <i>aspect2</i>:{<i>valueC</i>|<i>valueD</i>|...},.</code> <br /><br /> A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect. <br /><br /> <span class=\"tablenote\"> <strong>Note:</strong> Aspect names and values are case sensitive. </span> <br /><br /> Here is an example of an <b>aspect_filter</b> parameter in which <code>9355</code> is the category ID, <code>Color</code> is an aspect of that category, and <code>Black</code> and <code>White</code> are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability): <br /><br /> <code>GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search?<br /> aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black}</code>    <br /><br /> Here is the <b>aspect_filter</b> with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability): <br /><br /> <code>GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search?<br /> aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D,<br /> Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D</code> <br /><br /> <span class=\"tablenote\"> <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use the <b>aspect_filter</b> parameter in the same method with either the <b>gtin</b> parameter or the <b>mpn</b> parameter. </span> For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/catalog/types/catal:AspectFilter
