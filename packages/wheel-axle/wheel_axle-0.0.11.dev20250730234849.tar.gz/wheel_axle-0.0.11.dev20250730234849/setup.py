Python wheel does not support symlinks.\n2. Python wheel does not support overwriting in a convenient way:\n    * whether the distribution is pure-Python\n    * distribution ABI tag\n    * extend Python tag override capability\n\n## Solution\n\n**WARNING: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL BETA SOFTWARE. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nADDITIONAL INCLUDED DISCLAIMERS ALSO APPLY.**\n\nWheel-Axle (`axle`, `bdist_axle`) is a drop-in replacement/augmentation utility for `wheel` (`bdist_wheel`)\nthat extends and builds spec-compliant wheels.\n\nDuring the build, `axle` is able to capture and record in the Python wheel the symlinks in the following\nschema paths (locations):\n\n* purelib\n* platlib\n* scripts\n* headers\n* data\n\nAdditionally, `Axle` is able to customize the Python wheel tags via additional command line options.\n\nWhile the generated Python wheel is fully spec-compliant, additional symlink functionality is not possible without its\ncompanion library [Wheel Axle Runtime](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime). Thus, every Python wheel\ngenerated by the `bdist_axle` automatically becomes dependent on `wheel-axle-runtime` that provides\npost-install logic required.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe body of the library is as ugly and messy as `distutils`/`setuptools` are, and consists of, mainly, in\nhacking/overwriting various `setuptools` commands to detect, handle and record symlinks and their targets. Once that\nproblem is solved, the list of symlinks is recorded in the `.dist-info/symlinks.txt`\nin the following CSV format:\n\n1. symlink name\n2. symlink target\n3. a boolean (0 or 1) flag indicating whether the target is a directory\n\n**NOTE: Symlinks may be relative, absolute and/or broken. Symlink targets are recorded verbatim (even when broken) and\nare NOT otherwise interpreted. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. Please\nsee [Wheel Axle Runtime Security Notice](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime#security)\nfor additional information.**\n\nA special `<distribution name and version>.pth` file is also added to the distribution. When the wheel is installed\nthis `.pth` file triggers the post-install logic via\n[wheel-axle-runtime](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime).\n\n## Usage\n\n`python setup.py bdist_wheel <arguments>` can be replaced with `python setup.py bdist_axle <arguments>`. The replacement\nis drop-in.\n\nAdditional functionality is available via the following options:\n\n```commandline\n  --python-tag        Python implementation compatibility tag (default: 'py3')\n  --root-is-pure      set to manually override whether the wheel is\n                      pure (default: None)\n  --abi-tag           set to override ABI tag (default: None)\n  --require-libpython set to indicate the package requires libpython in the\n                       exec_prefix/platlib\n```\n\nUsing `--python-tag`, `--root-is-pure` and `--abi-tag` allows you to create wheels that carry platform-dependent data\nwhile otherwise containing pure-Python libraries.\n",
