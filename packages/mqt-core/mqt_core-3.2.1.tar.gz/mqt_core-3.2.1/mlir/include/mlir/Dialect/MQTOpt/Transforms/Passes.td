  let summary = "This pass performs a round trip to MQT Core's QuantumComputation and back";
  let description = [{
    This pass starts by extracting all quantum-computation-relevant operations and then
    translates them into an MQT Core quantum computation, deleting all quantum operations
    in the process. Then, the quantum computation is read in a second pattern and used
    to generate new MLIR code from it.

    This pass makes the following assumptions:
    - Each module consists of a single function that uses `mqtopt` operations with just a single qubit register.
    - All qubits are measured exactly once and the boolean measurement results are returned from the function in order.
    - The first returned value is the `AllocOp` that constructs a qubit register.
    - Measurements/Operations may only target a single qubit. Unitary operations may also use any number of (positive) controls.
    - Supported operations are `x`, `y`, `z`, `h`, and `measure`.

  let description = [{
    This pass searches for applications of gates that are their own inverses. Walking down their def-use chain,
    it then checks if the same gate is applied once again. In that case, the two gates are cancelled.

    Consecutive applications of gphase, p, rx, ry, rz, rxx, ryy, rzz, and rzx are merged into one by adding their angles.
    The merged gate is currently not removed if the angles add up to zero.
