    web mode.

    Attributes:
        _web_trailers (Headers | None): Stores the trailers received in the last envelope, if any.

    Methods:
        __init__(web, codec, read_max_bytes, stream=None, compression=None):
            Initializes the GRPCUnmarshaler with the specified parameters.

        async unmarshal(message):
            Asynchronously unmarshals a given message, yielding each resulting object and
            handling trailers in web mode.

        web_trailers:
            Returns the trailers received in the last envelope, or None if no trailers were received.
