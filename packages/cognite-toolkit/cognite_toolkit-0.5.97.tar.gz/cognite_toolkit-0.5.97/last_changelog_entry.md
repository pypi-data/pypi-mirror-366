## cdf 

### Added

- [alpha] New command `cdf purge instances` that enables you to delete
all nodes/edges with properties in specified views. This also includes
unlinking of timeseries if you select the `CogniteTimeSeries` view or
any extension of it and the timeseries were migrated with the `cdf
migrate timeseries` command.
