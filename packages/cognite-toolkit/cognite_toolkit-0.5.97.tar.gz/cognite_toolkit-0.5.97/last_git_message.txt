[CDF-25151] ðŸ§¹ cdf purge instances (#1711)

# Description

Stacked on <del>#1769 #1770 #1774 </del>

**Reviewer**: Please forgive me for the slight above limit PR. The core
of this PR is 230 lines with 200 lines of tests. Then, there are 80
lines of the CLI interface and some small boiler plate used for setting
the `alpha` flag we use.

Main motivation for this command is migration. We see that users are
making mistakes and then they need to clean up.

### Added

- [alpha] New command `cdf purge instances` that enables you to delete
all nodes/edges with properties in specified views. This also includes
unlinking of timeseries if you select the `CogniteTimeSeries` view or
any extension of it and the timeseries were migrated with the `cdf
migrate timeseries` command.
