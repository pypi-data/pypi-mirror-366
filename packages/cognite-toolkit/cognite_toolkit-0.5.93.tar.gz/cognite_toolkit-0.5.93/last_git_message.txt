[CDF-25247] ðŸ¦‹ Refactor interactive selection asset centric (#1745)

# Description

Stacked on #1744 

Extend the `AssetCentricInteractiveSelect` with methods for selecting
one or multiple data sets/root assets. These will be used with the
profiling commands to select root assets.

Note the `AssetCentricInteractiveSelect` is used for interactively
selecting root assets and data sets to do some operation. Today, it is
only used in the dump method, but will soon also be used in the
profiling.
