[CDF-25387] ðŸ¤– Publish agents issue (#1812)

# Description

Currently there are unofficial properties in the Agents API. These will
likely be removed/changed, however, we cannot ignore them in a CICD
setting as the unofficial property `labels` is used to determine whether
an Agent is shown in the UI or not.

This PR ensures that all unofficial properties are passed from the API
to the YAML file in `cdf dump agents` and when reading the YAML file and
deploying it with the `cdf deploy`.

In addition, since we are updating the `cognite-sdk` to the version that
includes the `AgentsAcl` we have to include this in the builtin modules
read and read-write all. (We have a tests that ensure that these modules
are up-to-date with all available ACLs.
