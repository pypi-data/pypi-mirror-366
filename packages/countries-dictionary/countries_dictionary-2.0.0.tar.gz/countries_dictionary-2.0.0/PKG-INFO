Countries Dictionary provides: 
- A dictionary contains all members and observer states of the United Nations and information about them:
  - Formal name
  - Continent(s) of the countries' mainland
  - Area in square kilometre
  - Population
  - Official languages
  - Nominal GDP in dollar
  - Human Development Index
- Another dictionary contains all federal subjects of the Russian Federation (including occupied zones in Ukraine) and information about them:
  - Federal district
  - Economic region
  - Area
  - Population
- Another one contains all provinces and municipalities of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and information about them:
  - Region
  - Area
  - Population
 - Some variables you might find helpful

After importing them:
```python
from countries_dictionary import countries
from countries_dictionary.russia import russia
from countries_dictionary.vietnam import vietnam
import countries_dictionary.quick_variables as qv
```
you can do many things with the dictionary, such as calculate GDP per capita of a country:
```python
countries["Switzerland"]["nominal GDP"] / countries["Switzerland"]["population"]
```
population density:
```python
countries["Russia"]["population"] / countries["Russia"]["area"]
```
percentage of a Vietnamese province's area compared to Vietnam's total area:
```python
vietnam["Ho Chi Minh City"]["area"] / countries["Vietnam"]["area"] * 100
```
or just see the dictionary when France is censored (This is only a joke, I don't support hate against France and French)
```python
qv.countries_france_censored
```

I created this module as a source of countries' information that is easy to access and use by coders.
