Notes:

# compilations not updating

```
The issue was that even after running maturin develop (or build with or
without --release) there were some .so files for the python package that were
not overwritten. That's why starting from scratch worked (once) since those
original files were gone. After I delete it (together with the __pycache__ dir)
the python side is up to date. 

```
