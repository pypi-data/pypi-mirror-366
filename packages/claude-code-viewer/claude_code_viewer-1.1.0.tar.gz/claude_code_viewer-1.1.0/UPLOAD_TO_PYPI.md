## 🔑 Step 1: Get PyPI Token

1. Go to [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and create account (if needed)
2. Enable 2FA on your account
3. Go to [Account Settings → API Tokens](https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens)
4. Click "Add API token"
   - **Name**: `claude-code-viewer`
   - **Scope**: "Entire account" (for first upload)
5. **Copy the token** (starts with `pypi-`)

## 🚀 Step 2: Upload to PyPI

**Option A: Direct Upload (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /media/sukhon/usbd/python_projects/converters/claude-code-viewer

# Set up your PyPI token (run once)
pip install keyring
keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
# When prompted, paste your PyPI token (the one starting with pypi-)

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

**Option B: Test First (Safer)**
```bash
# Test on TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
# Username: __token__
# Password: your-pypi-token

# If successful, upload to real PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```
