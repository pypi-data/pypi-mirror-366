## Summary

We've successfully implemented 10 comprehensive examples for KayGraph, covering:
- Cognitive AI patterns (TAR)
- Production observability (Tracing)
- External service integration (Google Calendar)
- Human interaction (HITL)
- Real-time features (Streaming)
- Visualization tools
- Voice interfaces
- Consensus mechanisms
- Async programming
- Protocol integration (MCP)

Each example includes:
- Comprehensive README documentation
- Working implementation with specialized nodes
- Main runner with CLI interface
- Utility functions where needed

The remaining 5 examples would add:
- More UI options (Gradio)
- Background processing (FastAPI)
- Real-time communication (WebSocket)
- Multi-agent patterns (A2A)
- Basic messaging (Communication)

All examples follow KayGraph's philosophy of zero dependencies in the core framework while showing how to integrate with external tools when needed.
