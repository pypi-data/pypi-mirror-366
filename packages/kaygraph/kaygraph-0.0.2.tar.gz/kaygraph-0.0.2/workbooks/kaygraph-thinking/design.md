# KayGraph Chain-of-Thought Implementation

This workbook demonstrates how to implement Chain-of-Thought reasoning using KayGraph.

## Overview

The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach helps LLMs solve complex problems by:
1. Breaking down problems into smaller steps
2. Maintaining a structured plan
3. Evaluating progress iteratively
4. Self-correcting when needed

## Design

### Graph Structure

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    start[StartNode] --> cot[ChainOfThoughtNode]
    cot -->|"continue"| cot
    cot -->|"done"| end[EndNode]
```

### Node Descriptions

- **StartNode**: Initializes the thinking process with the problem
- **ChainOfThoughtNode**: Self-looping node that orchestrates the thinking process
- **EndNode**: Captures the final solution

### Key Features

1. **Structured Planning**: Each thought maintains a hierarchical plan with:
   - Description of the step
   - Status tracking (Pending/Done/Verification Needed)
   - Results when completed
   - Sub-steps for complex tasks

2. **Thought Evaluation**: Each iteration:
   - Evaluates the previous thought
   - Executes the next pending step
   - Updates the plan structure
   - Decides whether to continue

3. **KayGraph Enhancements**:
   - Uses `MetricsNode` for performance tracking
   - Leverages enhanced logging
   - Implements proper error handling with retries
   - Uses node IDs for better tracking

### Shared State Structure

```python
{
    "problem": str,                    # The problem to solve
    "thoughts": List[Dict[str, Any]],  # List of thought records
    "current_thought_number": int,     # Counter for thoughts
    "solution": Optional[str],         # Final solution when done
    "plan": List[Dict[str, Any]]      # Current hierarchical plan
}
```

### Implementation Notes

- The node uses YAML format for structured LLM responses
- Plan updates are tracked through the shared state
- The process terminates when the "Conclusion" step is executed
- Each thought builds upon previous ones for coherent reasoning
