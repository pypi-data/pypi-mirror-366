This module enhances mail threads by using the mail queue by default.

Without this module, Odoo attempts to notify recipients of your message
immediately. If your mail server is slow or you have many followers,
this can mean a lot of time. Install this module and make Odoo more
snappy!

All emails will be kept in the outgoing queue by at least 30 seconds,
giving you some time to re-think what you wrote. During that time, you
can still delete the message and start again.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

You usually don't need to do anything. The module is configured
appropriately out of the box. Just make sure the following scheduled
actions are active:

- Mail: Email Queue Manager (mail.ir_cron_mail_scheduler_action)
- Notification: Send scheduled message notifications
  (mail.ir_cron_send_scheduled_message)

The mail queue processing is made by a cron job. This is normal Odoo
behavior, not specific to this module. However, since you will start
using that queue for every message posted by any user in any thread,
this module configures that job to execute every minute by default.

You can still change that cadence after installing the module (although
it is not recommended). To do so:

1. Log in with an administrator user.
2. Activate developer mode.
3. Go to *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*.
4. Edit the action named "Mail: Email Queue Manager".
5. Lower down the frequency in the field *Execute Every*. Recommended: 1
   minute.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to the form view of any record that has a mail thread. It can be a
   partner, for example.
2. Post a message.

The mail is now in the outgoing mail queue. It will be there for at
least 30 seconds. It will be really sent the next time the "Mail: Email
Queue Manager" cron job is executed.

While the message has not been yet sent:

1. Click the little envelope. You will see a paper airplane icon,
   indicating it is still outgoing.
2. Hover over the message and click on *‚†á > üóëÔ∏è Delete*. Mails will not
   be sent.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Add minimal deferring time configuration if it ever becomes necessary.
  See https://github.com/OCA/social/pull/1001#issuecomment-1461581573
  for the rationale behind current hardcoded value of 30 seconds.
