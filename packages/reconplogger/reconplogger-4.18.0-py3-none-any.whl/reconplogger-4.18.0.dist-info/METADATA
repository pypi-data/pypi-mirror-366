reconplogger - omni:us python logger
====================================

Docs: https://reconplogger.readthedocs.io/ | Source: https://github.com/omni-us/reconplogger/

This repository contains the code of reconplogger, a python package intended to
ease the standardization of logging within omni:us. The main design decision of
reconplogger is to allow total freedom to reconfigure loggers without hard
coding anything.

The package contains essentially the following things:

- A default logging configuration.
- A function for loading logging configuration for regular python code.
- A function for loading logging configuration for flask-based microservices.
- An inheritable class to add a logger property.
- A context manager to set and get the correlation id.
- Lower level functions for:

  - Loading logging configuration from any of: config file, environment variable, or default.
  - Replacing the handlers of an existing Logger object.
  - Function to add a file handler to a logger.
