## ▓▒░ DISCLAIMER NOTICE ░▒▓

**Important**: LazyScan displays a disclaimer on **first run only** to inform users about:
- Cache deletion may affect application performance
- Applications may need to rebuild caches after deletion
- Always verify files before deletion
- Use at your own risk

The disclaimer requires acknowledgment on first use. After acknowledgment, it won't be shown again unless you reset the configuration (~/.config/lazyscan/preferences.ini). Using the `--no-logo` flag skips both the logo and disclaimer display.

## Unity Hub Integration

LazyScan now includes Unity Hub Integration, allowing you to discover and manage your Unity projects more efficiently. Simply select your projects and execute LazyScan to see detailed insights into your Unity project's cache and other directories.
