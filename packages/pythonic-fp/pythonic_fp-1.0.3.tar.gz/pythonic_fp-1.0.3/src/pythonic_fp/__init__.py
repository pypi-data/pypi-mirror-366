"""PyPI pythonic-fp namespace stub project

**WARNING: DO NOT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE**

It is an empty module whose purpose is to claim the`pythonic-fp` name on PyPI.
This name is used by a family of namespace PyPI packages to support a functional
style of programming which still endeavors to remain Pythonic.

If this module is installed the rest of the namespace packages will no longer
work.
