---

The [planetary-coverage](https://docs.planetary-coverage.org)
package is a toolbox to perform surface coverage analysis based on orbital trajectory calculations.
Its main intent is to provide an easy way to compute observation
opportunities of specific region of interest above the Galilean
satellites for the ESA-Juice mission but could be extended in the
future to other space mission.

It is actively developed by the
[Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers Nantes Atlantique](https://osuna.univ-nantes.fr)
(OSUNA, CNRS-UAR 3281) and the
[Laboratory of Planetology and Geosciences](https://lpg-umr6112.fr)
(LPG, CNRS-UMR 6112) at Nantes University (France), under
[ESA-Juice](https://sci.esa.int/web/juice) and [CNES](https://cnes.fr) founding support.

üì¶ Installation
---------------

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/planetary-coverage/) and can be installed very easily:

- If you are in a [`Jupyter environnement`](https://jupyter.org/), you can use the magic command `%pip` in a notebook cell and ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `Run` it:
```bash
%pip install planetary-coverage
```

- or, if you are using a `terminal environment`, you can do:
```bash
pip install planetary-coverage
```

> __Note:__ If you plan to use this package with Juice and you want to enable [PTR simulation with AGM](https://esa-ptr.readthedocs.io/).
> You can add a `juice` extra parameter in the `pip` install command: `pip install planetary-coverage[juice]`


The package is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/planetary-coverage)
and you can install it with `conda`:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict

conda install planetary-coverage
```

üé® Contribution and üêõ fix bugs
-------------------------------

Contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
An account on the [Juice Giltab](https://gitlab.esa.int/juice-soc-public/python/planetary-coverage) is required.
You also need to install the recent version of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (`2.x`), for example on _Linux/macOS/Windows (WSL)_, you can run this command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then you are good to go!

1. üç¥ [Fork this project](https://gitlab.esa.int/juice-soc-public/python/planetary-coverage/-/forks/new)

2. üêë Clone and üì¶ install the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://juigitlab.esac.esa.int/<YOUR_USERNAME>/planetary-coverage
cd planetary-coverage

poetry install --all-groups
```

3. ‚úçÔ∏è Make your edits and üöß write the tests.

4. üö¶ Check that the linter and formatter are happy üò± ü§î üòÉ :
```bash
poetry run ruff format --diff
poetry run ruff check
```

5. üõ† Check that your tests succeed üëç and you have a coverage of 100% ‚ú® :

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

6. üìñ Complete and ‚öôÔ∏è build the documentation (if needed):
```bash
cd docs/
poetry run make docs
```

7. üì§ Push your changes to your forked branch and üöÄ open a [new merge request](https://gitlab.esa.int/juice-soc-public/python/planetary-coverage/-/merge_requests/new) explaining what you changed üôå üëè üí™.
